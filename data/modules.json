In this module, you'll learn how everyday agreements become legally binding contracts.\n\n---\n\n## The Big Picture\n\n> **Section 2(h), Indian Contract Act, 1872**\n> \n> *\"An agreement enforceable by law is a contract.\"*\n\nThis single definition is the foundation of everything you'll learn. Let's break it down.\n\n---\n\n## The Contract Equation\n\n```\nCONTRACT = AGREEMENT + ENFORCEABILITY\n         = (Offer + Acceptance) + Legal Backing\n```\n\n### Understanding Each Component\n\n| Component | What It Means | Example |\n|-----------|--------------|----------|\n| **Offer** | A proposal to do or not do something | \"I'll sell you my laptop for Rs. 30,000\" |\n| **Acceptance** | Agreeing to the exact terms of the offer | \"I agree to buy it for Rs. 30,000\" |\n| **Enforceability** | Courts can compel performance or award damages | If seller refuses, buyer can sue |\n\n---\n\n## The Golden Rule\n\n> **All contracts are agreements, but all agreements are not contracts.**\n\nThis is THE most frequently tested concept in CLAT!\n\n### Why Some Agreements Aren't Contracts\n\n**Scenario 1: The Dinner Promise**\nRahul promises to take Priya to dinner on Saturday. He doesn't show up.\n- Is this a contract? **NO**\n- Why? No intention to create legal relations\n- Can Priya sue? **NO**\n\n**Scenario 2: The Car Sale**\nRahul agrees to sell his car to Priya for Rs. 5 lakhs. He refuses to deliver.\n- Is this a contract? **YES**\n- Why? Commercial agreement with legal intention\n- Can Priya sue? **YES**\n\n---\n\n## Landmark Case Study\n\n### Balfour v. Balfour (1919)\n\n**The Story:**\nMr. Balfour worked in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). His wife fell ill and couldn't travel back with him. He promised to pay her £30 monthly until she could join him. Later, they separated, and he stopped paying.\n\n**The Question:**\nCould Mrs. Balfour enforce the promise in court?\n\n**The Verdict:**\n**NO** - The court held that domestic arrangements between spouses are not intended to be legally binding. There was no contract.\n\n**CLAT Takeaway:**\nDomestic/social agreements = Presumed NO intention to create legal relations\nCommercial agreements = Presumed intention to create legal relations\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Question:** A father promises his son Rs. 10,000 if he scores above 90% in exams. The son scores 95% but the father refuses to pay. Can the son sue?\n\n**Think about it before reading the answer below...**\n\n**Answer:** Generally NO. This is a domestic arrangement presumed to lack legal intention. However, if there's evidence the parties intended it to be legally binding, courts might enforce it.\n\n---\n\n## Key Definitions to Remember\n\n| Term | Section | Definition |\n|------|---------|------------|\n| **Agreement** | 2(e) | Every promise and every set of promises forming consideration for each other |\n| **Promise** | 2(b) | A proposal when accepted becomes a promise |\n| **Contract** | 2(h) | An agreement enforceable by law |\n| **Void Agreement** | 2(g) | An agreement not enforceable by law |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> In CLAT passages, look for phrases like:\n> - \"agreed to\" (suggests contract)\n> - \"promised informally\" (might lack enforceability)\n> - \"commercial transaction\" (strong indication of contract)\n> - \"between friends/family\" (might lack legal intention)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Recap\n\n1. Contract = Agreement + Enforceability\n2. Agreement = Offer + Acceptance  \n3. Not all agreements are contracts\n4. Social/domestic agreements usually lack legal intention\n5. Commercial agreements are presumed to have legal intention\n\n**Next up:** We'll explore the essential elements that make an agreement a valid contract!",

          "content": "## The Building Blocks: Offer & Acceptance\n\nEvery contract starts with an offer and ends with acceptance. Understanding these concepts deeply is crucial for CLAT.\n\n---\n\n## What is an Offer?\n\n> **Section 2(a): Proposal (Offer)**\n> \n> When one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other, he is said to make a proposal.\n\n### The Three Requirements of a Valid Offer\n\n| Requirement | What It Means | Example of Failure |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| **Definite & Certain** | Terms must be clear | \"I'll sell you my car for a fair price\" (What's fair?) |\n| **Communicated** | Offeree must know about it | Reward offer not communicated |\n| **Made with intent** | Must intend legal relations | Joke offers don't count |\n\n---\n\n## Types of Offers\n\n### 1. Specific Offer\nMade to a particular person. Only that person can accept.\n\n**Example:** \"Ravi, I'll sell you my bike for Rs. 50,000.\"\n- Only Ravi can accept\n- If Ravi's friend Amit says \"I accept,\" no contract is formed\n\n### 2. General Offer\nMade to the public at large. Anyone can accept by performing the conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Landmark Case: The Smoke Ball That Changed Law\n\n### Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)\n\n**The Advertisement:**\n*\"£100 reward will be paid to any person who contracts influenza after using the Carbolic Smoke Ball three times daily for two weeks.\"*\n\nThe company even deposited £1,000 in a bank to show sincerity.\n\n**What Happened:**\nMrs. Carlill used the smoke ball as directed but still caught the flu. She claimed the £100.\n\n**Company's Defense:**\n- \"It's just an advertisement, not a serious offer\"\n- \"You can't contract with the whole world\"\n- \"She never communicated her acceptance\"\n\n**Court's Ruling:**\n1. The deposit of £1,000 showed serious intent\n2. You CAN make an offer to the whole world\n3. In general offers, acceptance is by performance (no need to communicate)\n\n**CLAT Application:**\nGeneral offers are accepted by conduct/performance, not by communicating acceptance.\n\n---\n\n## Offer vs. Invitation to Offer\n\nThis distinction appears frequently in CLAT!\n\n| Situation | Is it an Offer? | Why? |\n|-----------|-----------------|------|\n| \"Car for sale: Rs. 5 lakhs\" (advertisement) | NO - Invitation | Invites people to make offers |\n| \"I'll sell this car to you for Rs. 5 lakhs\" | YES - Offer | Specific proposal to specific person |\n| Price tag on goods in shop | NO - Invitation | Shop invites offers from customers |\n| Auction: Auctioneer's call | NO - Invitation | Bidders make offers |\n| Auction: Bidder's bid | YES - Offer | Accepted by hammer fall |\n| Menu at restaurant | NO - Invitation | Customer offers to buy |\n\n---\n\n## Special Types of Offers\n\n### Cross Offers\nTwo parties make identical offers to each other simultaneously, crossing in transit.\n\n**Example:**\n- A writes to B: \"I'll sell my horse for Rs. 1 lakh\"\n- B writes to A: \"I'll buy your horse for Rs. 1 lakh\"\n- Letters cross in post\n\n**Result:** NO CONTRACT! Neither letter is an acceptance of the other.\n\n### Counter Offer\nA modified acceptance that kills the original offer.\n\n**Example:**\n- A: \"I'll sell my laptop for Rs. 40,000\"\n- B: \"I'll buy it for Rs. 35,000\"\n\n**Result:** A's offer is dead. B has made a NEW offer. A can accept or reject.\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance: Completing the Contract\n\n> **Section 2(b):** When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted.\n\n### Rules of Valid Acceptance\n\n1. **Absolute & Unconditional**\n   - Must accept exact terms\n   - Any variation = counter offer\n\n2. **Communicated to Offeror**\n   - Silence ≠ Acceptance\n   - Mental acceptance not enough\n\n3. **In Prescribed Manner**\n   - If mode specified, follow it\n   - If not specified, reasonable mode okay\n\n4. **Within Reasonable Time**\n   - Before offer lapses\n   - What's reasonable depends on circumstances\n\n---\n\n## The Postal Rule (Communication)\n\n### Section 4: When is Communication Complete?\n\n| Event | Complete Against... | When? |\n|-------|--------------------|---------|\n| **Offer** | Proposer | When received by offeree |\n| **Acceptance** | Proposer | When letter is POSTED |\n| **Acceptance** | Acceptor | When letter REACHES proposer |\n\n**Practical Implication:**\nIf A posts acceptance on Monday, contract is formed on Monday (against A).\nIf letter reaches B on Wednesday, contract is formed on Wednesday (against B).\n\n---\n\n## Revocation (Taking Back)\n\n### Can You Revoke an Offer?\nYES - anytime before acceptance is complete against you.\n\n### Can You Revoke Acceptance?\nYES - but only before it reaches the offeror.\n\n**Example:**\n- A offers by letter on Monday\n- B accepts by letter on Tuesday\n- A sends revocation on Wednesday\n\n**Result:** Too late! Acceptance was complete against A on Tuesday (when posted). Revocation on Wednesday is ineffective.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n**Situation:**\nOn June 1, A offers to sell his house to B for Rs. 50 lakhs through a letter. B receives the letter on June 3. On June 4, B posts his acceptance. On June 5, A phones B and says, \"I revoke my offer.\" B's letter of acceptance reaches A on June 6.\n\n**Question:** Is there a valid contract?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Offer received by B: June 3\n- Acceptance posted by B: June 4 (contract complete against A)\n- A's revocation: June 5 (TOO LATE!)\n- Acceptance reaches A: June 6\n\n**Answer:** YES, valid contract exists from June 4.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Quick Tips\n\n> - Advertisement = Usually invitation to offer\n> - Price tags = Invitation to offer\n> - \"I will pay Rs. X to whoever...\" = General offer\n> - Counter offer = Rejection + New offer\n> - Silence ≠ Acceptance\n> - Acceptance by post = Complete when posted",

          "content": "## Consideration: The Price of a Promise\n\nA promise without consideration is generally not enforceable. Let's understand why \"something in return\" matters.\n\n---\n\n## What is Consideration?\n\n> **Section 2(d):**\n> When at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing something, such act or abstinence or promise is called consideration.\n\n### In Simple Terms\n\nConsideration = What you give in exchange for what you get\n\n| Party | Gives | Gets |\n|-------|-------|------|\n| Seller | Goods | Money |\n| Buyer | Money | Goods |\n\nBoth sides must provide consideration!\n\n---\n\n## Key Features of Consideration\n\n### 1. Must Move at the Desire of the Promisor\n\n**Case: Durga Prasad v. Baldeo (1880)**\n\nDurga Prasad built shops at the request of the Collector (government official). Baldeo, who benefited from the market, promised to pay Durga Prasad a commission.\n\n**Held:** No valid contract. The construction was done at the Collector's desire, not Baldeo's.\n\n**Rule:** If you do something without being asked, you can't claim it as consideration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. May Move from Promisee or Any Other Person\n\n**Unique Indian Position!**\n\n**Case: Chinnaya v. Ramayya (1882)**\n\n- A (mother) gifted land to her daughter (D)\n- In return, D promised to pay annuity to A's brother (C)\n- D failed to pay\n\n**Question:** Can C sue D even though C provided no consideration?\n\n**Held:** YES! In India, consideration can come from \"any other person.\"\n\n**Comparison:**\n| English Law | Indian Law |\n|-------------|------------|\n| Consideration must come from promisee only | Consideration can come from promisee OR third party |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Past Consideration is Valid in India\n\n**Case: Sindha Shri Ganpatsingji v. Abraham (1895)**\n\nServices rendered in the past can be valid consideration for a subsequent promise.\n\n**Example:**\n- A saves B from drowning (no prior agreement)\n- B later promises to pay A Rs. 10,000 for saving him\n\n**In India:** Past service = Valid consideration (if done at promisor's request or he later promises payment)\n\n**In England:** Past consideration = No consideration\n\n---\n\n### 4. Need Not Be Adequate\n\n> **Section 25, Explanation 2:**\n> \"An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void merely because the consideration is inadequate.\"\n\n**Example:**\nA agrees to sell his BMW worth Rs. 50 lakhs to B for Rs. 1 lakh.\n\n**Valid contract?** YES! Courts don't judge whether the bargain is fair.\n\n**But remember:** Grossly inadequate consideration might indicate fraud or undue influence.\n\n---\n\n## Exceptions: When No Consideration is Needed\n\n### Section 25 Exceptions\n\n| Exception | Requirements | Example |\n|-----------|--------------|----------|\n| **Natural Love & Affection** | Written, registered, between close relatives | Father's written promise to gift property to son |\n| **Past Voluntary Service** | Service rendered voluntarily, promisor was to compensate | Employer promising pension for past service |\n| **Promise to Pay Time-Barred Debt** | Written and signed | Promise to pay debt barred by limitation |\n\n### Section 185: Agency\nNo consideration needed to create an agency.\n\n---\n\n## Capacity to Contract\n\n> **Section 11:**\n> Every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority, and who is of sound mind, and is not disqualified from contracting by any law.\n\n---\n\n## Who CANNOT Contract?\n\n### 1. Minors (Below 18 years)\n\n**Landmark Case: Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903)**\n\n**Facts:**\nDharmodas Ghose, a minor, mortgaged his property to a moneylender (Brahmo Dutt). The moneylender's agent knew Dharmodas was a minor.\n\n**Question:** Is the mortgage valid?\n\n**Held (Privy Council):** The mortgage was VOID AB INITIO (void from the beginning). A minor's agreement is not merely voidable but VOID.\n\n**Implications:**\n- Minor cannot be sued on the contract\n- Minor cannot ratify the contract on attaining majority\n- No restitution can be claimed from minor\n\n### Protection for Minors\n\n| Situation | Minor Protected? |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| Minor takes loan | Cannot be asked to repay |\n| Minor cheats about age | Still protected (Sadiq Ali case) |\n| Necessaries supplied to minor | Estate (not minor personally) is liable |\n| Beneficial contract of service | Valid (for minor's benefit) |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Persons of Unsound Mind\n\n> **Section 12:** A person is of sound mind if, at the time of making the contract, he is capable of understanding it and forming a rational judgment about its effects.\n\n| Category | Can Contract? |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Usually unsound, sometimes sound | Yes, during sound intervals |\n| Usually sound, sometimes unsound | No, during unsound periods |\n| Drunk/intoxicated person | No, if incapable of understanding |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Persons Disqualified by Law\n\n- **Alien enemies** (during war)\n- **Foreign sovereigns** (with immunity)\n- **Convicts** (undergoing sentence)\n- **Insolvent persons** (for certain contracts)\n- **Corporations** (beyond their charter)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Case Summary\n\n| Case | Principle |\n|------|----------|\n| **Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose** | Minor's contract is void ab initio |\n| **Durga Prasad v. Baldeo** | Consideration must be at promisor's desire |\n| **Chinnaya v. Ramayya** | Consideration can move from third party |\n| **Balfour v. Balfour** | Domestic agreements lack legal intention |\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Q1:** A minor obtains a loan by falsely claiming to be an adult. Can the lender recover the money?\n\n**Answer:** No. Minor is protected even in cases of fraud. (But equity court might order restoration of identifiable property.)\n\n**Q2:** A promises to pay B Rs. 50,000 in gratitude for B saving A's life last year. Is there consideration?\n\n**Answer:** Yes, in India. Past voluntary service is valid consideration if the promisor agrees to compensate.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> When a CLAT passage involves a minor:\n> - Contract is likely VOID (not voidable)\n> - Minor cannot be sued\n> - Look for \"beneficial contracts\" exception\n> - \"Necessaries\" make the estate liable, not the minor",

Coercion (Section 15)\n\n**Definition:** Committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code, or unlawfully detaining or threatening to detain any property.\n\n### Key Elements\n- Act must be forbidden by IPC\n- Intent to cause person to enter agreement\n- Need not be directed at contracting party\n\n### Landmark Case: Ranganayakamma v. Alwar Setti (1889)\n\n**Facts:** A widow was prevented from removing her husband's dead body until she adopted a boy as per relatives' wishes.\n\n**Held:** This was coercion. The adoption was voidable.\n\n---\n\n### Coercion vs. Duress\n\n| Coercion (Indian Law) | Duress (English Law) |\n|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Threat of any IPC offense | Only threat to person |\n| Need not be by contracting party | Must be by contracting party |\n| Need not be directed at contracting party | Must be directed at contracting party |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Undue Influence (Section 16)\n\n**Definition:** When one party is in a position to dominate the will of another and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage.\n\n### When Does Position to Dominate Exist?\n\n1. **Real or apparent authority** over the other\n2. **Fiduciary relationship** (trust-based)\n3. **Mental capacity affected** by age, illness, or distress\n\n### Presumed Relationships\n\n| Relationship | Presumption of Undue Influence? |\n|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| Parent - Child | YES |\n| Guardian - Ward | YES |\n| Doctor - Patient | YES |\n| Lawyer - Client | YES |\n| Spiritual Guru - Devotee | YES |\n| Husband - Wife | NO (must be proved) |\n| Creditor - Debtor | NO (must be proved) |\n\n---\n\n### Case Study: The Pardanashin Woman\n\n**Concept:** Women who observe purdah (seclusion) are presumed to be under undue influence when they sign documents without independent advice.\n\n**Case: Ismail Mussaji v. Hafiz Boo (1906)**\n\nA pardanashin woman signed a gift deed without understanding. Presumption of undue influence applied, and the deed was set aside.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Fraud (Section 17)\n\n**Definition:** Fraud includes acts committed with intent to deceive or induce a person to enter into a contract.\n\n### Essential Elements of Fraud\n\n1. **False representation** of fact\n2. Made **knowingly** or **without belief in truth** or **recklessly**\n3. With **intent to deceive**\n4. Other party **acted upon it**\n5. Other party **suffered damage**\n\n### What Constitutes Fraud?\n\n| Act | Fraud? |\n|-----|--------|\n| False statement of fact | YES |\n| Active concealment of defect | YES |\n| Promise without intention to perform | YES |\n| Any act to deceive | YES |\n| Mere silence | Usually NO (but exceptions exist) |\n\n---\n\n### When is Silence Fraud?\n\n> **Section 17:** Mere silence is NOT fraud UNLESS:\n> 1. Duty to speak exists (fiduciary relationships)\n> 2. Silence is equivalent to speech\n\n**Example:** \n- Insurance applicant must disclose health conditions\n- Seller of horse must reveal known disease (if asked)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Misrepresentation (Section 18)\n\n**Definition:** Unintentional false statement made believing it to be true, or breach of duty which gains advantage, or causing mistake about subject matter.\n\n### Fraud vs. Misrepresentation\n\n| Aspect | Fraud | Misrepresentation |\n|--------|-------|-------------------|\n| **Intent** | Deliberate deception | Innocent/unintentional |\n| **Belief** | Knows statement is false | Believes statement is true |\n| **Remedies** | Contract voidable + Damages | Contract voidable only |\n| **Right to damages** | YES | NO |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Mistake (Sections 20-22)\n\n### Types of Mistake\n\n```\n              MISTAKE\n                 |\n       +---------+---------+\n       |                   |\n   MISTAKE OF           MISTAKE OF\n     FACT                  LAW\n       |                   |\n   (May affect         (Generally no\n    contract)            relief)\n       |\n   +-------+-------+\n   |               |\n BILATERAL      UNILATERAL\n (Both parties)  (One party)\n   |               |\nContract VOID   Contract Valid\n                (usually)\n```\n\n### Bilateral Mistake of Essential Fact\n\n> **Section 20:** Agreement void when both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact essential to agreement.\n\n**Example:** A agrees to buy B's horse. Unknown to both, the horse is dead at the time of agreement. Contract is VOID.\n\n### Unilateral Mistake\n\n> **Section 22:** Contract not voidable merely because one party was mistaken about facts.\n\n**Exception:** If the other party knew of the mistake, contract may be void.\n\n---\n\n## Effect of Vitiating Consent\n\n| Factor | Contract Status | Who Can Avoid? |\n|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Coercion | Voidable | Party coerced |\n| Undue Influence | Voidable | Weaker party |\n| Fraud | Voidable | Party deceived |\n| Misrepresentation | Voidable | Party misled |\n| Bilateral Mistake | VOID | Neither (no contract exists) |\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n**Scenario:**\nA, an old man on his deathbed, signs a property transfer deed prepared by his son B. A cannot read the document due to poor eyesight. B tells A it's a will, but it's actually a sale deed transferring property to B for Rs. 1.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What factors vitiate consent here?\n2. Is the contract valid?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Undue Influence:** Son in position to dominate aged, ill father\n- **Fraud:** False representation about nature of document\n- **Inadequate consideration:** Rs. 1 for property (indicates unfairness)\n\n**Answer:** Contract is VOIDABLE at A's option due to both fraud and undue influence.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Coercion** = IPC threat, physical/property\n> **Undue Influence** = Relationship-based domination\n> **Fraud** = Intentional deception\n> **Misrepresentation** = Innocent false statement\n> \n> Remember: Voidable means the wronged party has a CHOICE to avoid or continue.",

          "content": "## When Contracts Go Wrong\n\nWhat happens when a party doesn't perform their obligations? Let's explore breach and its remedies.\n\n---\n\n## What is Breach of Contract?\n\n**Definition:** When a party fails to perform their obligations under a contract, or indicates unwillingness to perform.\n\n---\n\n## Types of Breach\n\n### 1. Actual Breach\n\n**At the time of performance:**\n- Party fails to perform when due\n- Party performs but improperly/incompletely\n\n**Example:** A agrees to deliver goods on June 1. On June 1, A refuses to deliver.\n\n### 2. Anticipatory Breach\n\n**Before performance is due:**\n- Party declares they won't perform\n- Party makes performance impossible\n\n**Example:** On May 15, A tells B, \"I will not deliver the goods on June 1.\"\n\n---\n\n### Anticipatory Breach: The Aggrieved Party's Options\n\n| Option | Implication |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Treat contract as broken immediately** | Sue at once, no need to wait for performance date |\n| **Keep contract alive** | Wait until performance date, risk of losing right if circumstances change |\n\n**Case: Hochster v. De La Tour (1853)**\n\nDe La Tour hired Hochster as a courier for a June trip. In May, he cancelled. Hochster sued in May itself.\n\n**Held:** Hochster could sue immediately upon anticipatory breach. No need to wait until June.\n\n---\n\n## Remedies for Breach\n\n```\n            REMEDIES\n                |\n     +----------+----------+\n     |          |          |\n  DAMAGES   SPECIFIC    INJUNCTION\n              PERFORMANCE\n     |          |          |\n  Money    Actual work   Prohibitory\n  compensation  ordered   order\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1. Damages (Monetary Compensation)\n\n### Types of Damages\n\n| Type | Description | Example |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Ordinary/General** | Natural consequence of breach | Loss of profit due to non-delivery |\n| **Special** | Arising from special circumstances (known to both) | Loss of special contract because of breach |\n| **Exemplary/Punitive** | Punishment for wrongful conduct | Rare in contract law |\n| **Nominal** | Token amount when no actual loss | Rs. 1 awarded |\n| **Liquidated** | Pre-determined by parties | \"Rs. 1 lakh per day delay\" |\n\n---\n\n### The Rule in Hadley v. Baxendale (1854)\n\n**The Leading Case on Remoteness of Damages**\n\n**Facts:**\n- Hadley's mill shaft broke\n- He gave it to Baxendale (carrier) to deliver to manufacturer\n- Baxendale delayed delivery\n- Mill remained shut, causing huge losses\n- Hadley sued for loss of profits\n\n**Held:** Baxendale was NOT liable for lost profits because:\n1. Loss of profits was not a natural consequence (he didn't know there was no spare shaft)\n2. Special circumstances were not communicated\n\n**The Rule:**\nDamages are recoverable only if:\n1. They arise naturally from breach (foreseeable), OR\n2. Special circumstances were known to both parties\n\n---\n\n### Mitigation of Damages\n\n> The aggrieved party must take reasonable steps to minimize loss.\n\n**Example:** If seller breaches, buyer can't wait and let losses accumulate. Buyer must try to get goods elsewhere at reasonable price.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Specific Performance\n\n**Definition:** Court orders the party to actually perform their promise.\n\n### When Granted?\n\n| Granted | NOT Granted |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Unique property (land, rare art) | Personal service contracts |\n| No adequate monetary remedy | Continuous supervision required |\n| Contract is clear and certain | One-sided/unfair contracts |\n| Consideration is fair | Specific performance impossible |\n\n### Case: Specific Performance of Land Sale\n\nLand is considered unique. If seller refuses to sell, court can order actual transfer instead of just damages.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Injunction\n\n**Definition:** Court order preventing a party from doing something.\n\n**Types:**\n- **Prohibitory:** \"Don't do X\"\n- **Mandatory:** \"Do X\" (rare)\n\n**Classic Example:**\nA singer agrees not to perform for anyone else during contract period. If she tries to perform elsewhere, court can issue injunction stopping her.\n\n**Note:** Can't force her to sing (specific performance), but CAN stop her from singing elsewhere (injunction).\n\n---\n\n## Other Remedies\n\n### Rescission\n- Treating the contract as cancelled\n- Parties restored to original position\n\n### Quantum Meruit\n- \"As much as deserved\"\n- Payment for work actually done when full performance is prevented\n\n**Example:** A is contracted to build 100 rooms. After 50 rooms, B wrongfully terminates. A can claim reasonable payment for 50 rooms.\n\n---\n\n## Penalty vs. Liquidated Damages\n\n**Under Indian Law (Section 74):**\n\nUnlike English law, India treats both similarly:\n- Only REASONABLE compensation awarded\n- Even if contract says \"Rs. 10 lakhs penalty,\" court will assess actual loss\n- Court not bound by stated amount\n\n**Example:**\n- Contract: \"Rs. 1 crore penalty for any breach\"\n- Actual loss: Rs. 5 lakhs\n- Court will award: Reasonable amount based on actual loss, not Rs. 1 crore\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Remedy | Nature | When Used |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| **Damages** | Monetary | Most breach cases |\n| **Specific Performance** | Actual performance | Unique subject matter |\n| **Injunction** | Prohibitory order | Negative covenants |\n| **Rescission** | Cancellation | Contract vitiated |\n| **Quantum Meruit** | Part payment | Partial performance |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> When analyzing remedy questions:\n> 1. Can money adequately compensate? → Damages\n> 2. Is subject matter unique? → Specific Performance\n> 3. Is there a negative promise? → Injunction\n> 4. Was contract wrongfully terminated midway? → Quantum Meruit",

          "content": "## How Contract Law Appears in CLAT\n\nLet's decode the CLAT approach to contract law questions.\n\n---\n\n## Question Format\n\n### Passage-Based Questions\n\nCLAT typically presents:\n1. A **passage** (300-400 words) explaining a legal principle or case\n2. **4-5 questions** based on the passage\n3. Questions test **application**, not just recall\n\n---\n\n## Sample CLAT-Style Passage\n\n> **Read the passage and answer the questions:**\n>\n> The Indian Contract Act defines a contract as an agreement enforceable by law. For an agreement to be enforceable, several conditions must be satisfied. First, there must be an offer by one party and acceptance by another. The acceptance must be absolute and unconditional; any modification amounts to a counter-offer.\n>\n> Second, both parties must have the capacity to contract. Under Section 11, a person must be a major (18 years or above), of sound mind, and not disqualified by law. An agreement with a minor is void ab initio, meaning it is void from the very beginning and cannot be ratified even after the minor attains majority.\n>\n> Third, the consent of parties must be free from coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake. When consent is obtained through any of these means, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was so obtained.\n>\n> Fourth, there must be lawful consideration and lawful object. An agreement without consideration is generally void, though exceptions exist for agreements made out of natural love and affection between near relatives, promises to compensate for past voluntary services, and promises to pay time-barred debts.\n\n---\n\n## Question Types\n\n### Type 1: Direct Application\n\n**Question:** Rahul, a 16-year-old, borrows Rs. 50,000 from a bank by showing a fake ID claiming he is 19. Can the bank recover the money?\n\n**How to approach:**\n1. Identify the issue: Minor's contract\n2. Apply the rule: Minor's agreement is void ab initio\n3. Consider exceptions: Even fraud by minor doesn't make contract valid\n4. Answer: Bank cannot recover (but may have equitable remedies for identifiable property)\n\n---\n\n### Type 2: Comparative Analysis\n\n**Question:** Which of the following statements is CORRECT?\n\na) A voidable contract is void from the beginning\nb) A void contract can be ratified\nc) An illegal contract makes all collateral agreements void\nd) A minor can ratify his contract on attaining majority\n\n**Analysis:**\n- (a) Wrong: Voidable is valid until avoided\n- (b) Wrong: Void contracts cannot be ratified\n- (c) CORRECT: Illegality taints collateral agreements\n- (d) Wrong: Minor's agreement is void, nothing to ratify\n\n---\n\n### Type 3: Scenario Analysis\n\n**Question:** A offers to sell his car to B for Rs. 5 lakhs. B says, \"I accept, provided you repaint it blue.\" Is there a contract?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- B's response contains a condition\n- This is a counter-offer, not acceptance\n- The counter-offer terminates A's original offer\n- Answer: No contract. B made a counter-offer.\n\n---\n\n### Type 4: Exception Identification\n\n**Question:** Which agreement WITHOUT consideration is VALID?\n\na) A's promise to gift Rs. 1 lakh to his friend\nb) A's written promise to pay his time-barred debt to B\nc) A's oral promise to his nephew for past services\nd) A's promise to pay Rs. 5,000 to whoever finds his dog\n\n**Analysis:**\n- (a) Invalid: No consideration, no exception applies (friend ≠ near relative)\n- (b) VALID: Written promise to pay time-barred debt (Section 25(3))\n- (c) Invalid: Must be in writing for S.25(2)\n- (d) Invalid: This actually HAS consideration (the finder's effort)\n\n---\n\n## The CLAT Problem-Solving Framework\n\n```\nStep 1: READ carefully, identify FACTS\n           ↓\nStep 2: IDENTIFY the legal issue\n        (Offer? Acceptance? Capacity? Consent? Consideration?)\n           ↓\nStep 3: RECALL the relevant rule\n        (Section number if known)\n           ↓\nStep 4: APPLY rule to facts\n           ↓\nStep 5: CHECK for exceptions\n           ↓\nStep 6: SELECT the best answer\n```\n\n---\n\n## Common CLAT Traps\n\n### Trap 1: Void vs. Voidable\n**Wrong thinking:** \"The contract can be cancelled, so it's voidable.\"\n**Right thinking:** Check WHO can cancel. If it's void, neither party needs to do anything.\n\n### Trap 2: Silence = Acceptance\n**Wrong thinking:** \"He didn't say no, so he accepted.\"\n**Right thinking:** Silence is NEVER acceptance (unless special circumstances).\n\n### Trap 3: Consideration Adequacy\n**Wrong thinking:** \"Rs. 1 for a car is too low, so it's not valid consideration.\"\n**Right thinking:** Courts don't check adequacy. Even Rs. 1 is valid consideration.\n\n### Trap 4: Minor's Fraud\n**Wrong thinking:** \"Minor lied about age, so he's liable.\"\n**Right thinking:** Minor is protected even when committing fraud.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n**Q1:** A writes to B offering to sell his house for Rs. 50 lakhs. B writes back, \"I accept your offer. Please include the furniture too.\" Is there a contract?\n\n**Answer:** NO. B's response is a counter-offer (adds condition about furniture). Original offer is terminated.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:** A doctor tells his patient, \"Sign this paper to authorize your surgery.\" The paper actually transfers the patient's property to the doctor. What vitiating factor is present?\n\n**Answer:** FRAUD (Section 17) - Deliberate misrepresentation of document's nature. Contract is voidable.\n\n---\n\n**Q3:** A promises to pay Rs. 1 lakh to B, his nephew, \"out of natural love and affection.\" The promise is made orally. Can B enforce it?\n\n**Answer:** NO. For the natural love and affection exception (S.25), the agreement must be:\n1. In writing\n2. Registered\n3. Between parties in near relation\nOral promise doesn't satisfy requirement (1).\n\n---\n\n## Memory Hooks for CLAT\n\n| Topic | Memory Hook |\n|-------|-------------|\n| All contracts are agreements | ACE → Agreements that are Contracts are Enforceable |\n| Section 10 elements | OICLCCP → Offer, Intention, Consideration, Lawful object, Capacity, Consent, Possibility |\n| Void Agreements | ULTRA CW → Unlawful, Lack of consideration, Trade restraint, Restraint of marriage, Agreements uncertain, Court proceedings, Wagering |\n| Vitiating Consent | CUFMM → Coercion, Undue influence, Fraud, Misrepresentation, Mistake |\n\n---\n\n## Final Tips\n\n1. **Read the passage twice** - once for overall understanding, once for details\n2. **Underline key facts** - age of parties, exact words of agreement, timing\n3. **Identify the section** - most questions map to specific sections\n4. **Eliminate wrong options first** - often 2 options are clearly wrong\n5. **Don't overthink** - CLAT tests basic principles, not edge cases",

The 14-year rule is only for remission eligibility.\n\n---\n\n## Key Definitions\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|--------|\n| **Offense** | Any act/omission punishable by law |\n| **Accused** | Person against whom proceeding is initiated |\n| **Complainant** | Person who lodges complaint |\n| **Public Prosecutor** | Government lawyer who prosecutes |\n| **Cognizable Offense** | Police can arrest without warrant |\n| **Bailable Offense** | Right to bail exists |\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Question:** A, while sleepwalking, picks up a knife and stabs B. Is A criminally liable?\n\n**Think about it...**\n\n**Answer:** Generally NO. Sleepwalking is an unconscious act, so there's no voluntary actus reus. A's act was not voluntary, hence no crime.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> In criminal law questions, always check:\n> 1. Was there a guilty ACT (actus reus)?\n> 2. Was there a guilty MIND (mens rea)?\n> 3. Do any EXCEPTIONS apply?\n> \n> If any element is missing, there's no crime!",

Each classification has different legal consequences.\n\n---\n\n## Classification Matrix\n\n```\n              OFFENSE CLASSIFICATION\n                      |\n    +---------+-------+-------+---------+\n    |         |       |       |         |\n COGNIZABLE  BAIL   COMPOUND  TRIAL   SEVERITY\n    |         |       |       |         |\n  Yes/No   Yes/No   Yes/No  Summons/  Felony/\n                           Warrant  Misdemeanor\n```\n\n---\n\n## 1. Cognizable vs. Non-Cognizable\n\n> **Cognizable:** Police can arrest WITHOUT warrant and investigate WITHOUT court permission.\n\n| Aspect | Cognizable | Non-Cognizable |\n|--------|------------|----------------|\n| **Arrest** | Without warrant | Only with warrant |\n| **Investigation** | Without court permission | Needs court order |\n| **Seriousness** | Generally serious | Less serious |\n| **Examples** | Murder, rape, theft, robbery | Assault, defamation, cheating |\n| **FIR** | Mandatory to register | Police may refuse |\n\n### Practical Scenario\n\n**Situation:** Rahul witnesses a robbery and rushes to the police station.\n\n- Police MUST register FIR (cognizable offense)\n- Police CAN immediately arrest suspects\n- Police CAN start investigation without court order\n\n**Situation:** Priya wants to file complaint about defamation.\n\n- Police MAY refuse to register FIR\n- Police CANNOT arrest without warrant\n- Priya may need to approach Magistrate directly\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bailable vs. Non-Bailable\n\n| Aspect | Bailable | Non-Bailable |\n|--------|----------|---------------|\n| **Right to Bail** | YES (as of right) | NO (discretionary) |\n| **Who Grants** | Police or Court | Only Court |\n| **Seriousness** | Less serious | Serious offenses |\n| **Examples** | Hurt, theft (minor) | Murder, rape, dacoity |\n\n> **Memory Aid:** \"Bail is jail's opposite - serious crimes don't get easy bail\"\n\n### The Bail Flowchart\n\n```\nOffense Committed\n       |\n   Bailable? ──YES──→ Right to bail\n       |              (Police/Court can grant)\n       NO\n       |\n   Non-Bailable\n       |\n   Court decides based on:\n   - Nature of offense\n   - Criminal history\n   - Flight risk\n   - Tampering with evidence\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Compoundable vs. Non-Compoundable\n\n> **Compoundable:** Parties can settle the matter and withdraw prosecution.\n\n| Type | Court Permission? | Examples |\n|------|------------------|----------|\n| **Compoundable (S.320(1))** | Not needed | Hurt, defamation, mischief (minor) |\n| **Compoundable (S.320(2))** | Needed | Voluntarily causing grievous hurt, theft |\n| **Non-Compoundable** | Cannot compound | Murder, rape, dacoity |\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- Compoundable = Victim and accused can reach settlement\n- Non-Compoundable = State will prosecute regardless of victim's wishes\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summons vs. Warrant Cases\n\n| Summons Case | Warrant Case |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| Punishment ≤ 2 years | Punishment > 2 years or death |\n| Simpler procedure | Elaborate procedure |\n| Accused summoned to appear | Warrant may be issued |\n| Example: Hurt (S.323) | Example: Murder (S.302) |\n\n---\n\n## IPC Chapter-wise Classification\n\n| Chapter | Subject | Key Sections |\n|---------|---------|-------------|\n| V | Abetment | 107-120 |\n| VI | Against State | 121-130 |\n| IX | Against Public Servants | 161-171 |\n| XVI | **Against Human Body** | 299-377 |\n| XVII | **Against Property** | 378-462 |\n| XVIII | Documents/Currency | 463-489 |\n| XX | Marriage Offenses | 493-498 |\n| XXI | Defamation | 499-502 |\n| XXII | Criminal Intimidation | 503-510 |\n\n> **Most Important for CLAT:** Chapters XVI (Human Body) and XVII (Property)\n\n---\n\n## First Information Report (FIR)\n\n> **Section 154 CrPC / Section 173 BNSS**\n\n### What is an FIR?\n- First information about a cognizable offense\n- Sets criminal justice process in motion\n- Recorded at police station\n\n### FIR Essentials\n\n| Aspect | Requirement |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Who can lodge?** | Anyone (victim, witness, any person) |\n| **Form** | Writing, signed by informant |\n| **Free copy** | Must be given to informant |\n| **Timing** | Preferably immediately, but no time limit |\n| **Zero FIR** | Can be filed at ANY police station |\n\n### Landmark Case: Lalita Kumari v. State of UP (2014)\n\n**Issue:** Can police refuse to register FIR for cognizable offense?\n\n**Held:** NO. Registration of FIR is MANDATORY for cognizable offenses. Police cannot conduct preliminary inquiry before registration.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n**Scenario:** A slaps B in a marketplace, causing minor hurt. B wants to file a case.\n\n**Analyze:**\n1. **Cognizable?** Generally non-cognizable (simple hurt)\n2. **Bailable?** Yes\n3. **Compoundable?** Yes (S.323 - without court permission)\n4. **Trial Type?** Summons case (punishment ≤ 2 years)\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> When classifying an offense, use this checklist:\n> - **C**ognizable or not?\n> - **B**ailable or not?\n> - **C**ompoundable or not?\n> - **S**ummons or Warrant case?\n> \n> Remember: **CBCS** - the four classifications!",

Intention\n\n> **Definition:** Conscious desire to bring about a particular result\n\n### Characteristics\n- Highest degree of mens rea\n- Premeditated and deliberate\n- Accused WANTED the result\n\n### Example\nA plans for weeks to murder B. He buys poison, waits for opportunity, and poisons B's food.\n- A's mental state: **INTENTION** to kill\n- Crime: **Murder** (S.300)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Knowledge\n\n> **Definition:** Awareness that act will likely cause a certain result\n\n### Characteristics\n- Lower than intention\n- Accused KNEW result was likely but didn't specifically desire it\n- Proceeds despite knowing consequences\n\n### Example\nA fires a gun into a crowded market to scare people. A bullet kills B.\n- A didn't WANT to kill B specifically\n- But A KNEW firing into crowd could kill someone\n- Crime: **Culpable Homicide** (may not be murder)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Negligence\n\n> **Definition:** Failure to exercise reasonable care\n\n### Characteristics\n- Lowest culpable mental state\n- No desire or knowledge of harm\n- A reasonable person would have been more careful\n\n### Example\nA drives recklessly at high speed. Car hits and kills B.\n- A didn't WANT to kill\n- A didn't KNOW he would kill\n- But A SHOULD HAVE been more careful\n- Crime: **Death by Negligence** (S.304A)\n\n---\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n| Mental State | \"What was accused thinking?\" | Example Crime | Punishment |\n|--------------|------------------------------|---------------|------------|\n| **Intention** | \"I want B dead\" | Murder | Death/Life |\n| **Knowledge** | \"B might die, but let's see\" | Culpable Homicide | Up to 10 years |\n| **Negligence** | \"Oops, I didn't mean to\" | Death by Negligence | Up to 2 years |\n\n---\n\n## General Exceptions (Chapter IV, IPC)\n\nThese defenses NEGATE criminal liability even if actus reus occurred.\n\n### The Complete List\n\n| Section | Exception | Key Points |\n|---------|-----------|------------|\n| 76, 79 | **Mistake of Fact** | Honest, reasonable belief |\n| 77 | **Judicial Act** | Judge acting in good faith |\n| 80 | **Accident** | Lawful act, no intention |\n| 81 | **Necessity** | Lesser harm to prevent greater |\n| 82 | **Child under 7** | Complete immunity |\n| 83 | **Child 7-12** | Immature understanding |\n| 84 | **Insanity** | McNaughten Rules |\n| 85-86 | **Intoxication** | Involuntary only |\n| 87-91 | **Consent** | Valid consent defense |\n| 96-106 | **Private Defense** | Proportionate force |\n\n---\n\n## Deep Dive: Key Exceptions\n\n### 1. Minority (Sections 82-83)\n\n```\nAge of Child:\n\n  Under 7 years ───→ COMPLETE IMMUNITY\n                     (Doli incapax - incapable of crime)\n                     \n  7-12 years ──────→ IMMUNITY IF immature understanding\n                     (Presumption of innocence)\n                     \n  Above 12 years ──→ TRIED AS JUVENILE\n                     (Juvenile Justice Act applies)\n```\n\n### 2. Insanity (Section 84)\n\n> **McNaughten Rules (1843)**\n\nTo claim insanity defense:\n1. Accused must have mental disease\n2. At TIME of act, didn't know:\n   - Nature and quality of act, OR\n   - That act was wrong\n\n**Case: Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai v. State of Gujarat (1964)**\n- Accused killed wife believing she was a snake\n- Held: Entitled to insanity defense - didn't know nature of act\n\n### 3. Private Defense (Sections 96-106)\n\n> **Right to defend oneself and property**\n\n| Requirement | Explanation |\n|-------------|------------|\n| **Imminent threat** | Danger must be immediate |\n| **Reasonable belief** | Honest fear of harm |\n| **Proportionate force** | Not excessive |\n| **No time for public help** | Cannot wait for police |\n\n**When can death be caused in private defense?**\n- Against assault causing reasonable fear of death\n- Against assault causing fear of grievous hurt\n- Against rape\n- Against kidnapping\n- Against robbery\n- Against house-breaking at night\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Q1:** A, aged 6, takes a loaded gun and shoots B dead. Is A liable?\n\n**Answer:** NO. Under Section 82, child under 7 has complete immunity.\n\n**Q2:** A gets very drunk at a party (voluntarily) and kills B. Can A claim intoxication defense?\n\n**Answer:** NO. Section 86 - Voluntary intoxication is NO defense for crimes requiring intention.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> When analyzing criminal liability:\n> 1.

INTENTION to cause death, OR\n> 2. INTENTION to cause bodily injury LIKELY to cause death, OR\n> 3. KNOWLEDGE that the act is LIKELY to cause death\n\n### Key Word: \"LIKELY\"\n\n---\n\n## Murder (Section 300)\n\n> **Definition:** Culpable homicide is MURDER if done with:\n\n### The Four Clauses\n\n| Clause | Description | Example |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| **1stly** | Intention to cause death | A shoots B in heart intending to kill |\n| **2ndly** | Intention to cause injury KNOWN to be likely to cause death | A stabs vital organ knowing it's fatal |\n| **3rdly** | Intention to cause injury SUFFICIENT IN ORDINARY COURSE to cause death | A hits B on head with iron rod |\n| **4thly** | Act so IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS that death is most probable | A throws bomb in crowd |\n\n### Key Words: \"SUFFICIENT\" and \"MUST/MOST PROBABLE\"\n\n---\n\n## The Critical Difference\n\n| Culpable Homicide | Murder |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Death is **LIKELY** | Death is **CERTAIN/HIGHLY PROBABLE** |\n| **Knowledge** that death may occur | **Intention** that death should occur |\n| Lower degree of probability | Higher degree of probability |\n| **\"Likely\"** | **\"Sufficient in ordinary course\"** |\n\n### The Classic Example\n\n**Scenario 1:** A hits B with a stick on the leg. B, unknown to A, has hemophilia. B bleeds to death.\n- A knew hitting might hurt B (LIKELY to cause harm)\n- A didn't know B would die\n- **Culpable Homicide NOT amounting to Murder**\n\n**Scenario 2:** A hits B on the head with an iron rod with full force.\n- A knew this blow is SUFFICIENT to cause death in ordinary course\n- **Murder**\n\n---\n\n## Five Exceptions (Reduces Murder to Culpable Homicide)\n\nEven if act falls under Section 300, these exceptions reduce it:\n\n### Exception 1: Grave and Sudden Provocation\n\n| Requirement | Explanation |\n|-------------|------------|\n| **Grave** | Serious enough to disturb ordinary person |\n| **Sudden** | No time to cool down |\n| **Not self-provoked** | Accused didn't invite provocation |\n| **Not from lawful act** | Public servant doing duty doesn't count |\n\n**Case: K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra (1962)**\n\nNaval officer Nanavati found his wife was having affair with Ahuja. He went home, got his revolver, drove to Ahuja's house, and shot him.\n\n**Held:** NOT grave and sudden provocation. There was time to cool down (went home, got gun, drove to location). Conviction for murder upheld.\n\n### Exception 2: Right of Private Defense Exceeded\n\n- Genuine attempt to exercise private defense\n- Exceeded proportionate force in good faith\n- Without premeditation\n\n### Exception 3: Public Servant Acting in Good Faith\n\n- Public servant exceeding legal powers\n- Acting in good faith for advancement of public justice\n\n### Exception 4: Sudden Fight\n\n| Requirement | Explanation |\n|-------------|------------|\n| **Sudden** | No premeditation |\n| **Heat of passion** | In the moment, not cold-blooded |\n| **No undue advantage** | Didn't use weapon against unarmed person |\n| **No cruel manner** | Didn't act with cruelty |\n\n### Exception 5: Death by Consent\n\n- Victim above 18 years\n- Gave consent to die\n- Example: Mercy killing cases (still controversial)\n\n---\n\n## Punishment Comparison\n\n| Offense | Section | Punishment |\n|---------|---------|------------|\n| **Murder** | 302 | Death OR Life imprisonment + Fine |\n| **Culpable Homicide** | 304(I) - With intention | Life OR up to 10 years + Fine |\n| **Culpable Homicide** | 304(II) - With knowledge | Up to 10 years + Fine |\n| **Death by Negligence** | 304A | Up to 2 years OR Fine OR Both |\n\n---\n\n## Landmark Cases\n\n### Reg v. Govinda (1876)\n\n**Facts:** Husband knocked down wife, knelt on her chest, struck her face with closed fist. She died.\n\n**Issue:** Murder or Culpable Homicide?\n\n**Held:** Culpable Homicide, not Murder. A blow with fist on face is not \"sufficient in ordinary course\" to cause death.\n\n### Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab (1958)\n\n**Facts:** Accused gave spear blow to victim's abdomen, penetrating intestines.\n\n**Held:** Murder under Clause 3rdly. Spear blow to abdomen IS sufficient in ordinary course to cause death.\n\n**The Virsa Singh Test:**\n1. Was there a bodily injury?\n2. Was the injury intentionally inflicted?\n3. Was the injury sufficient in ordinary course to cause death?\n\nIf all three YES → Murder under Clause 3rdly.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Table\n\n| Situation | Offense |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Planned killing | Murder (Clause 1) |\n| Stab to heart/vital organ | Murder (Clause 2 or 3) |\n| Throwing bomb in crowd | Murder (Clause 4) |\n| Killing in sudden fight | Culpable Homicide (Exception 4) |\n| Killing under grave provocation | Culpable Homicide (Exception 1) |\n| Killing by negligent driving | Death by Negligence (S.304A) |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The Three-Step Analysis:**\n> 1. Is it causing death? → Yes\n> 2. Is it Culpable Homicide under S.299? → Check intention/knowledge\n> 3. Is it Murder under S.300? → Check if \"sufficient\" or exceptions apply\n> \n> **Memory Hook:** \"Murder is CH + Higher Degree + No Exceptions\"",

Understanding the distinctions between theft, robbery, dacoity, and extortion is essential.\n\n---\n\n## The Property Offense Hierarchy\n\n```\n              THEFT (S.378)\n                   |\n             + FORCE/FEAR\n                   |\n              ROBBERY (S.390)\n                   |\n            + 5 OR MORE PERSONS\n                   |\n              DACOITY (S.391)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Theft (Section 378)\n\n> **Definition:** Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any moveable property out of the possession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property.\n\n### Essential Elements\n\n| Element | Requirement |\n|---------|------------|\n| **1. Moveable property** | Not land or things attached to land |\n| **2. Dishonest intention** | Intent to cause wrongful gain/loss |\n| **3. Without consent** | No permission from owner |\n| **4. Moving the property** | Even slightest movement counts |\n| **5. Out of possession** | From someone's possession |\n\n### Important Points\n\n- Property must be \"moveable\" (not immovable like land)\n- Even moving an inch = theft complete\n- Electricity can be stolen (S.39 defines as moveable)\n- Consent obtained by fraud = no valid consent = theft\n\n**Punishment:** Up to 3 years, or fine, or both (S.379)\n\n---\n\n## Extortion (Section 383)\n\n> **Definition:** Putting any person in fear of injury and thereby dishonestly inducing that person to deliver property.\n\n### Elements\n\n1. **Intentionally putting in fear** of injury\n2. **Dishonest inducement** to deliver property\n3. Person delivers property **due to fear**\n\n### Theft vs. Extortion\n\n| Theft | Extortion |\n|-------|----------|\n| Property is **taken** | Property is **delivered** |\n| Without consent | Consent obtained by fear |\n| Victim passive | Victim active (delivers) |\n| No communication needed | Threat must be communicated |\n\n**Example:**\n- A pickpockets B's wallet → **Theft**\n- A threatens B: \"Give me wallet or I'll harm your family\" → **Extortion**\n\n---\n\n## Robbery (Section 390)\n\n> **Definition:** Theft + Force/Fear OR Extortion + Immediate Harm\n\n### Two Ways to Commit Robbery\n\n**Type 1: Theft becomes Robbery when:**\n- To commit theft, OR\n- While committing theft, OR\n- Carrying away stolen property...\n- Offender causes/attempts to cause: death, hurt, fear of death/hurt, wrongful restraint\n\n**Type 2: Extortion becomes Robbery when:**\n- Offender puts victim in fear of instant death/hurt\n- Fear is of IMMEDIATE harm (not future)\n\n### The Key Distinction\n\n| Theft/Extortion | Robbery |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| No violence | Violence or fear of instant harm |\n| May be secretive | Confrontational |\n| Less severe | More severe |\n| S.378/383 | S.390 |\n\n**Punishment:** Up to 10 years + Fine (S.392). If on highway after sunset: Up to 14 years (S.393)\n\n---\n\n## Dacoity (Section 391)\n\n> **Definition:** When 5 or more persons conjointly commit or attempt robbery, it is dacoity.\n\n### Essential Elements\n\n1. **Five or more persons** (minimum)\n2. **Acting together** (conjointly)\n3. **Committing/attempting robbery**\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Even if only some actually rob, ALL are guilty\n- Attempt to commit robbery is enough\n- Need not all be present at scene\n\n**Punishment:** Life imprisonment or 10 years + Fine (S.395)\n\n---\n\n## Comparison Table\n\n| Offense | Key Feature | Section | Punishment |\n|---------|-------------|---------|------------|\n| **Theft** | Taking without consent | 378 | 3 years |\n| **Extortion** | Taking by fear (future) | 383 | 3 years |\n| **Robbery** | Taking by force/instant fear | 390 | 10-14 years |\n| **Dacoity** | Robbery by 5+ persons | 391 | Life or 10 years |\n\n---\n\n## Other Important Property Offenses\n\n### Criminal Misappropriation (S.403)\n- Dishonest misappropriation of property\n- Property came into possession HONESTLY\n- Later decides to keep it\n- Example: Finding lost wallet and keeping it\n\n### Criminal Breach of Trust (S.405)\n- Entrusted with property\n- Dishonestly misappropriates or converts\n- Violates the trust\n- Example: Employee embezzling company funds\n\n### Cheating (S.415)\n- Deceiving a person\n- Inducing to deliver property or do/omit something\n- Which causes damage\n- Example: Fake lottery scheme\n\n### Mischief (S.425)\n- Destroying or damaging property\n- With intent to cause wrongful loss\n- Example: Breaking someone's car window\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n**Scenario:** A points a knife at B and says, \"Give me your phone or I'll stab you.\" B hands over the phone. 4 friends of A are watching nearby.\n\n**Analyze:**\n- Threat of instant harm → Robbery (not just extortion)\n- Total persons involved: 5 (A + 4 friends)\n- If all 5 were acting together → **Dacoity**\n- If only A was acting → **Robbery**\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Memory Hook: TERD**\n> - **T**heft: Take without consent\n> - **E**xtortion: Fear of future injury\n> - **R**obbery: Force or fear of INSTANT harm\n> - **D**acoity: 5+ persons committing robbery\n> \n> Severity increases as you go down the list!",

Right to Equality (Articles 14-18)\n\n### Article 14: Equality Before Law\n\n> \"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.\"\n\n| Concept | Meaning | Origin |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| **Equality before law** | Absence of special privileges | British (Rule of Law) |\n| **Equal protection of laws** | Similar treatment for similar people | American |\n\n**Key Principle:** Reasonable classification is allowed, but NOT class legislation.\n\n**Case: E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (1974)**\n- Equality is dynamic, not static\n- \"Equality is antithetic to arbitrariness\"\n\n### Article 15: Prohibition of Discrimination\n\n**Prohibited Grounds:** Religion, Race, Caste, Sex, Place of Birth\n\n**Exceptions (Positive Discrimination):**\n- 15(3): Special provisions for women and children\n- 15(4): Special provisions for SC/ST\n- 15(5): Special provisions in educational institutions for SC/ST/OBC\n\n### Article 16: Equality in Public Employment\n\n**Exception:** Reservation under Article 16(4) for backward classes\n\n**Landmark Case: Indra Sawhney v.

Union of India (1978)\n\n**The Transformation of Article 21**\n\n**Facts:** Maneka Gandhi's passport was impounded without giving reasons. She challenged this.\n\n**Old View (A.K. Gopalan, 1950):**\n- \"Procedure established by law\" = Any procedure passed by legislature\n- Articles 14, 19, 21 are separate watertight compartments\n\n**New View (Maneka Gandhi, 1978):**\n- Procedure must be **fair, just, and reasonable**\n- Articles 14, 19, 21 form a **\"golden triangle\"**\n- Any law affecting life/liberty must pass **triple test**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Right Against Exploitation (Articles 23-24)\n\n### Article 23: Trafficking & Forced Labor\n- Prohibits human trafficking\n- Prohibits begar (forced labor without pay)\n- Prohibition is against State AND private persons\n\n### Article 24: Child Labor\n- No child below 14 in factories, mines, hazardous employment\n- Child Labour (Prohibition) Act enforces this\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Q:** A State law provides 75% reservation for locals in private jobs. Is this constitutional?\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Affects Article 19(1)(g) - freedom of profession\n- Affects Article 14 - equality\n- Reasonable or arbitrary?\n\n**Answer:** Likely unconstitutional. 75% is excessive and violates equality. (Reference: Haryana's law was challenged)\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Quick Checklist for FR Questions:**\n> 1. Who is affected? (Citizen vs. Person)\n> 2. Which FR applies?\n> 3. Is there a valid restriction?\n> 4. Is restriction reasonable?\n> \n> Remember: Articles 14, 20, 21 apply to ALL persons (including foreigners). Article 19 is only for CITIZENS.",

State of Kerala (1973)\n\n### The Story\n\n**Petitioner:** His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati, head of a religious mutt in Kerala\n\n**Challenge:** Kerala Land Reforms Act which affected his mutt's property\n\n**Real Question:** Can Parliament amend Fundamental Rights?\n\n**Bench:** 13 judges - largest ever in Supreme Court history\n\n**Verdict:** 7:6 majority\n\n### The Historic Ruling\n\n> \"Parliament has wide powers to amend the Constitution. However, it cannot alter the **Basic Structure** of the Constitution.\"\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. Parliament CAN amend any provision (including FRs)\n2. Parliament CANNOT destroy the Basic Structure\n3. Basic Structure is NOT defined exhaustively\n4. Courts will determine what is Basic Structure\n\n---\n\n## What is Basic Structure?\n\nThe Constitution never defines it. Courts identify it case by case.\n\n### Confirmed Elements\n\n| Element | Identified In |\n|---------|---------------|\n| Supremacy of Constitution | Kesavananda |\n| Republican, democratic form of government | Kesavananda |\n| Secular character | Kesavananda, S.R.

Gupta |\n| Welfare state | Kesavananda |\n\n---\n\n## Key Cases After Kesavananda\n\n### Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975)\n\n**Context:** Indira Gandhi's election was challenged. To save herself, 39th Amendment placed PM's election beyond judicial review.\n\n**Held:** Free and fair elections are part of Basic Structure. Amendment struck down.\n\n> This was the first time an amendment was struck down using Basic Structure Doctrine.\n\n---\n\n### Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)\n\n**Challenge:** 42nd Amendment (during Emergency) which:\n- Gave unlimited amending power to Parliament\n- Made DPSPs superior to FRs (Articles 14, 19, 21)\n\n**Held:** Both provisions struck down.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n> \"If the power of amendment is unlimited, the Constitution ceases to be supreme.\"\n\n**Basic Structure elements confirmed:**\n1. Limited amending power\n2. Judicial review\n3. Harmony between FRs and DPSPs\n\n---\n\n### I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (2007)\n\n**Issue:** Can laws in 9th Schedule be challenged?\n\n**Background:** 9th Schedule was created to protect laws from FR challenges.\n\n**Held:**\n- 9th Schedule doesn't provide blanket immunity\n- Laws added after April 24, 1973 (Kesavananda) can be challenged\n- If they violate Basic Structure, they can be struck down\n\n---\n\n## Article 368: Amendment Procedure\n\n### Two Types of Amendments\n\n| Type | Procedure | Examples |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| **By Special Majority** | 2/3rd of members present + voting AND majority of total membership | Most amendments |\n| **By Special Majority + State Ratification** | Above + ratification by half the states | Federal provisions, election of President, SC/HC, etc. |\n\n### What Special Majority Means\n\n```\nTotal members in Lok Sabha: 545\nFor Special Majority:\n- More than 272 (simple majority of total) must vote YES\n- AND 2/3rd of those present and voting must vote YES\n\nExample: If 400 members present\n- Need 267 (2/3 of 400) votes\n- Also need more than 272 (majority of 545)\n- So need at least 273 votes\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Balance of Power\n\n```\n           CONSTITUTION\n                |\n    +-----------+-----------+\n    |                       |\n PARLIAMENT              JUDICIARY\n    |                       |\n \"We can amend\"        \"But not\n                        Basic Structure\"\n    |                       |\n    +-------BALANCE--------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## Test Yourself\n\n**Q:** Parliament passes a Constitutional Amendment abolishing judicial review. Valid?\n\n**Answer:** NO. Judicial review is part of Basic Structure (Minerva Mills). Parliament cannot destroy Basic Structure.\n\n**Q:** Parliament passes amendment providing 100% reservation. Valid?\n\n**Answer:** Likely NO. It would destroy equality (Article 14), which is arguably Basic Structure.\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Basic Structure Questions Test:**\n> 1.

Master this, and you'll gain 8-10 marks with confidence.\n\n---\n\n## What is a Syllogism?\n\n> **Definition:**\n> A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning where a conclusion is drawn from two given statements (premises).\n\n**The Classic Example:**\n```\nPremise 1: All humans are mortal.\nPremise 2: Socrates is a human.\n─────────────────────────────────\nConclusion: Socrates is mortal.\n```\n\n---\n\n## The AEIO System\n\nEvery syllogism statement falls into one of four types. Memorize these letters - they're your toolkit!\n\n> **Memory Trick: \"AEIO\" = Vowels in order (skip U)**\n\n| Type | Letter | Format | Example | Meaning |\n|------|--------|--------|---------|----------|\n| **Universal Affirmative** | A | All X are Y | \"All cats are animals\" | Every single X belongs to Y |\n| **Universal Negative** | E | No X is Y | \"No cats are dogs\" | Not even one X belongs to Y |\n| **Particular Affirmative** | I | Some X are Y | \"Some cats are black\" | At least one X belongs to Y |\n| **Particular Negative** | O | Some X are not Y | \"Some cats are not pets\" | At least one X doesn't belong to Y |\n\n---\n\n## Understanding \"All\" vs \"Some\"\n\n### The \"All\" Trap\n\n> **CRITICAL:** \"All A are B\" does NOT mean \"All B are A\"\n\n**Example:**\n- \"All dogs are animals\" ✓\n- Does this mean \"All animals are dogs\"? ❌ NO!\n\n**Visual:**\n```\n        ┌─────────────────────┐\n        │     ANIMALS         │\n        │    ┌────────┐       │\n        │    │  DOGS  │       │\n        │    └────────┘       │\n        │         (cats, birds,│\n        │          fish etc.)  │\n        └─────────────────────┘\n```\n\nDogs are INSIDE animals, but animals is much bigger!\n\n---\n\n### The \"Some\" Meaning\n\n> **\"Some\" = At least one, possibly all**\n\n**Key Insight:**\n- \"Some A are B\" means: 1 or more A's are B\n- It could be 1, it could be 50%, it could be ALL\n- \"Some\" does NOT mean \"not all\"\n\n**CLAT Trap Example:**\n- Statement: \"Some politicians are honest\"\n- This is TRUE even if ALL politicians are honest!\n\n---\n\n## The Conversion Table\n\nConversion means switching subject and predicate. Not all statements can be converted!\n\n| Original Statement | Can Convert? | Converted Form |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| All A are B (A) | ✓ Limited | Some B are A (I) |\n| No A is B (E) | ✓ Full | No B is A (E) |\n| Some A are B (I) | ✓ Full | Some B are A (I) |\n| Some A are not B (O) | ❌ | Cannot convert |\n\n> **Memory Trick: \"O Cannot Convert\" - O is the Odd One Out!**\n\n---\n\n## The Distribution Concept\n\nA term is \"distributed\" when the statement talks about ALL members of that category.\n\n| Statement Type | Subject | Predicate |\n|----------------|---------|------------|\n| A (All X are Y) | ✓ Distributed | ✗ Not distributed |\n| E (No X is Y) | ✓ Distributed | ✓ Distributed |\n| I (Some X are Y) | ✗ Not distributed | ✗ Not distributed |\n| O (Some X are not Y) | ✗ Not distributed | ✓ Distributed |\n\n> **Memory Trick: \"AsEbIp Op\"**\n> - **A**ll distributes **S**ubject\n> - **E** distributes **B**oth\n> - **I** distributes **N**either (I = N = Nothing)\n> - **O** distributes **P**redicate only\n\n---\n\n## Five Golden Rules\n\nMemorize these - they help eliminate wrong answers quickly!\n\n### Rule 1: The Negative Rule\n> If one premise is negative, conclusion MUST be negative.\n> If both premises are affirmative, conclusion MUST be affirmative.\n\n### Rule 2: The Particular Rule\n> If one premise is particular, conclusion MUST be particular.\n> Two particulars = NO valid conclusion.\n\n### Rule 3: The Double Negative Rule\n> Two negative premises = NO valid conclusion possible.\n\n### Rule 4: The Middle Term Rule\n> The middle term (appears in both premises) must be distributed at least once.\n\n### Rule 5: The Conclusion Rule\n> A term distributed in conclusion must be distributed in its premise.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Practice\n\n**Statements:**\n1. All doctors are educated.\n2. Some educated are rich.\n\n**Identify the types:**\n- Statement 1: Type A (All...are)\n- Statement 2: Type I (Some...are)\n\n**What type of conclusion is possible?**\n- One is Universal (A), one is Particular (I)\n- Rule 2: Conclusion must be Particular\n- Both are Affirmative\n- Rule 1: Conclusion must be Affirmative\n- Answer: Only **I-type** (Some...are) conclusions are possible!\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Speed Technique:**\n> Before drawing diagrams, use AEIO rules to eliminate options!\n> \n> If premises are A + I → Only \"Some\" conclusions possible\n> If one premise is E or O → Only negative conclusions possible\n> If both are I or O → No valid conclusion (mark \"None follows\")",

Here's the systematic approach:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Three Terms\n\n**Statements:**\n1. All A are B\n2. All B are C\n\n**Terms:** A, B, C (B is the middle term - appears in both)\n\n### Step 2: Draw the Definite Relationship First\n\nStart with the \"All\" or \"No\" statements (they're definite).\n\n```\n              ┌───────────────────┐\n              │         C         │\n              │   ┌───────────┐   │\n              │   │     B     │   │\n              │   │   ┌───┐   │   │\n              │   │   │ A │   │   │\n              │   │   └───┘   │   │\n              │   └───────────┘   │\n              └───────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Analysis:** A is inside B, B is inside C, so A must be inside C!\n\n**Valid Conclusion:** All A are C ✓\n\n---\n\n## Solving with Multiple Possibilities\n\n**Statements:**\n1. All A are B\n2. Some B are C\n\n**Question:** Does \"Some A are C\" follow?\n\n### Draw Multiple Possibilities:\n\n**Possibility 1:** C overlaps with B but NOT with A\n```\n    ┌───────────────┐\n    │       B       │\n    │   ┌───┐   ┌───┤\n    │   │ A │   │ C ││\n    │   └───┘   └───┤\n    └───────────────┘\n```\n→ Some A are C? NO\n\n**Possibility 2:** C overlaps with both B and A\n```\n    ┌───────────────┐\n    │       B       │\n    │   ┌───╳───┐   │\n    │   │ A │ C │   │\n    │   └───┴───┘   │\n    └───────────────┘\n```\n→ Some A are C? YES\n\n**Verdict:** Since the conclusion doesn't hold in ALL possibilities, it **does not follow**.\n\n> **The Rule:** A conclusion follows ONLY if it's true in EVERY possible diagram.\n\n---\n\n## The Either-Or Technique\n\nWhen neither conclusion follows individually, check if they're **complementary pairs**.\n\n### Complementary Pairs:\n\n| Pair 1 | Pair 2 |\n|--------|--------|\n| All A are B | Some A are not B |\n| No A is B | Some A are B |\n\nIf conclusions are a complementary pair and neither follows alone → **\"Either I or II follows\"**\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Statements:**\n- Some cats are dogs.\n- Some dogs are birds.\n\n**Conclusions:**\nI. All cats are birds.\nII. Some cats are not birds.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Conclusion I (All cats are birds) - Doesn't follow (not definite)\n- Conclusion II (Some cats are not birds) - Doesn't follow (not definite)\n- Are they complementary? YES! (A vs O type)\n- Answer: **Either I or II follows**\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n**Statements:**\n1. All roses are flowers.\n2. No flower is a thorn.\n\n**Conclusions:**\nI. No rose is a thorn.\nII. Some thorns are roses.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n**Step 1:** Draw the diagram\n```\n    ┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐\n    │ FLOWERS │      │ THORNS  │\n    │ ┌─────┐ │      │         │\n    │ │ROSES│ │      │         │\n    │ └─────┘ │      │         │\n    └─────────┘      └─────────┘\n        (separate - No flower is thorn)\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Test conclusions\n- I. No rose is a thorn → Roses are in Flowers, Flowers are separate from Thorns → **FOLLOWS ✓**\n- II. Some thorns are roses → Thorns and Roses are completely separate → **DOES NOT FOLLOW ✗**\n\n**Answer:** Only I follows\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Speed Tips\n\n> 1. **Draw definite (A/E) first**, uncertain (I/O) later\n> 2. **If \"Some\" appears**, always ask: \"What are the possibilities?\"\n> 3. **Use rules before diagrams** to eliminate impossible conclusions\n> 4. **Complementary pairs** = automatic \"Either...or\"\n> 5. **Practice 10 problems daily** - speed comes from pattern recognition",

Clearly, the new strategy is effective.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Premise: Crime rate dropped 30% after new strategy\n- Conclusion: The new strategy is effective\n- Indicator: \"Clearly\" (conclusion indicator)\n\n---\n\n**Argument 2:**\n\"Since renewable energy costs have decreased by 50% over the past decade, and since public concern about climate change is at an all-time high, we should expect significant growth in solar panel installations.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Premise 1: Renewable energy costs decreased 50%\n- Premise 2: Public concern about climate change is high\n- Conclusion: Solar panel installations will grow significantly\n- Indicators: \"Since\" (premise), implied \"we should expect\" (conclusion)\n\n---\n\n## Types of Arguments\n\n### 1. Deductive Arguments\n\n> If premises are true, conclusion MUST be true.\n\n```\nPremise: All lawyers passed the bar exam.\nPremise: Rahul is a lawyer.\n──────────────────────────────────\nConclusion: Rahul passed the bar exam.\n```\n\n**Certainty Level:** 100% (if premises are true)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Inductive Arguments\n\n> Premises make conclusion PROBABLE, not certain.\n\n```\nPremise: The last 100 swans observed were white.\n──────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion: All swans are probably white.\n```\n\n**Certainty Level:** Less than 100% (could be exceptions)\n\n> **Fun Fact:** Black swans exist in Australia! This is why inductive reasoning can fail.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Causal Arguments\n\n> Claim that A causes B.\n\n```\nPremise: After the factory opened, river pollution increased.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion: The factory caused the river pollution.\n```\n\n**Watch Out:** Correlation ≠ Causation!\n\n---\n\n### 4. Analogy Arguments\n\n> If A is like B in some ways, A is probably like B in other ways.\n\n```\nPremise: City A reduced crime with community policing.\n         City B is similar to City A.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nConclusion: Community policing will reduce crime in City B.\n```\n\n**Strength depends on:** How similar A and B really are.\n\n---\n\n## The Logic Chain\n\n```\n    EVIDENCE → ASSUMPTION → CONCLUSION\n        ↓           ↓            ↓\n    What we      What's       What author\n    are told     unstated     wants us to\n                 but needed   believe\n```\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Question Types\n\n| Question Type | What You Do |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| \"What is the main conclusion?\" | Find the claim being argued |\n| \"What assumption underlies...?\" | Find the unstated link |\n| \"Which would strengthen...?\" | Add support for conclusion |\n| \"Which would weaken...?\" | Attack the argument's logic |\n| \"What can be inferred?\" | Draw logical conclusions |\n| \"What is the flaw in...?\" | Identify logical error |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The 3-Second Conclusion Check:**\n> 1.

          "content": "## The Art of Finding Assumptions\n\nAssumptions are the INVISIBLE BRIDGES between premises and conclusions. CLAT loves testing whether you can spot them!\n\n---\n\n## What is an Assumption?\n\n> **Definition:**\n> An assumption is an unstated belief that MUST be true for the argument to be valid.\n\n### The Gap Concept\n\n```\n    PREMISE ─────────────────────────> CONCLUSION\n                    ↑\n              [ASSUMPTION]\n              (The bridge)\n```\n\nThe assumption fills the GAP between what is stated and what is concluded.\n\n---\n\n## Example: The Gap in Action\n\n**Argument:**\n\"Ramesh has been working at the firm for 10 years. He deserves a promotion.\"\n\n**What's Stated (Premise):**\n- Ramesh worked for 10 years\n\n**What's Concluded:**\n- Ramesh deserves a promotion\n\n**The Gap:**\n- Why does working 10 years = deserving promotion?\n\n**The Assumption:**\n- Long tenure at a firm justifies promotion\n- OR: Years of service is a criterion for promotion\n\n---\n\n## The Negation Test\n\nThe most powerful tool for identifying assumptions!\n\n> **The Negation Test:**\n> 1. Take the potential assumption\n> 2. NEGATE it (make it say the opposite)\n> 3. If the argument FALLS APART → It's an assumption\n> 4. If the argument STILL WORKS → It's NOT an assumption\n\n### Example\n\n**Argument:**\n\"The new anti-pollution law will reduce respiratory diseases because it limits factory emissions.\"\n\n**Potential Assumption:**\n\"Factory emissions cause respiratory diseases.\"\n\n**Apply Negation Test:**\n- Negated: \"Factory emissions do NOT cause respiratory diseases.\"\n- Does the argument fall apart? YES!\n- If emissions don't cause diseases, limiting them won't help.\n\n**Verdict:** This IS an assumption. ✓\n\n---\n\n**Testing Wrong Assumptions:**\n\n**Potential Assumption:**\n\"The law was proposed by environmentalists.\"\n\n**Apply Negation Test:**\n- Negated: \"The law was NOT proposed by environmentalists.\"\n- Does the argument fall apart? NO!\n- The law's effect doesn't depend on who proposed it.\n\n**Verdict:** This is NOT an assumption. ✗\n\n---\n\n## Types of Assumptions\n\n### 1. Causal Assumptions\n\n> Assuming A causes B without considering other factors.\n\n**Argument:** \"After the training program, employee productivity increased. The program improved productivity.\"\n\n**Causal Assumption:** Nothing else (new tools, different projects, seasonal factors) caused the productivity increase.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Comparison/Analogy Assumptions\n\n> Assuming two things are similar enough to draw parallels.\n\n**Argument:** \"The educational reform worked in Finland. It will work in India too.\"\n\n**Comparison Assumption:** India and Finland are similar enough in relevant ways (education infrastructure, culture, resources).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Representativeness Assumptions\n\n> Assuming a sample represents the whole population.\n\n**Argument:** \"In a survey, 80% of Delhi residents supported the policy. Most Indians support it.\"\n\n**Representativeness Assumption:** Delhi residents' opinions represent all Indians' opinions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Feasibility Assumptions\n\n> Assuming a plan can actually be implemented.\n\n**Argument:** \"If we plant 10 million trees, climate change will be reversed.\"\n\n**Feasibility Assumption:** It's possible to plant and maintain 10 million trees.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Definition Assumptions\n\n> Assuming terms mean the same thing throughout.\n\n**Argument:** \"All successful people wake up early. Priya wakes up early. Priya will be successful.\"\n\n**Definition Assumption:** \"Success\" means the same thing in all instances.\n\n---\n\n## Common Assumption Patterns in CLAT\n\n| Pattern | What to Look For | Example |\n|---------|-----------------|----------|\n| **Past → Future** | Assuming past trends continue | \"It worked before, so it will work again\" |\n| **Part → Whole** | Assuming part represents whole | \"Some lawyers are corrupt, so the profession is corrupt\" |\n| **Correlation → Causation** | Assuming one thing causes another | \"Crime rose when he was mayor, so he caused crime\" |\n| **No Other Factors** | Assuming nothing else matters | \"Only this factor affects the outcome\" |\n| **Terms Stay Same** | Assuming definitions don't shift | \"Healthy food\" means same thing to everyone |\n\n---\n\n## Practice: Find the Assumption\n\n**Argument 1:**\n\"Since graduates from IIT earn high salaries, parents should send their children to IIT coaching classes.\"\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. Coaching classes help get into IIT\n2. Getting into IIT leads to high salary\n3. High salary is a goal worth pursuing\n4. The child is capable of benefiting from such coaching\n\n---\n\n**Argument 2:**\n\"The murder weapon was found in Ram's house. Ram must have committed the murder.\"\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. Ram had access to where the weapon was found\n2. No one else could have placed the weapon there\n3. The weapon wasn't planted as evidence\n4. Having the weapon implies using it\n\n---\n\n## The Assumption-Finding Strategy\n\n```\nStep 1: Identify the conclusion\n        ↓\nStep 2: Identify the evidence/premises\n        ↓\nStep 3: Ask: \"What's missing between evidence and conclusion?\"\n        ↓\nStep 4: That missing link is the assumption\n        ↓\nStep 5: Verify with Negation Test\n```\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Assumption Red Flags:**\n>\n> 1. **Scope changes** - Evidence about \"some\" → Conclusion about \"all\"\n> 2. **Time jumps** - Evidence from past → Conclusion about future\n> 3. **New terms** - Conclusion introduces terms not in premises\n> 4. **Causal claims** - Argument claims A caused B\n>\n> When you see these, there's likely a hidden assumption!",

Definite (Must Be True) Inference\n\n> Logically follows with 100% certainty.\n\n**Passage:** \"All CLAT toppers studied for at least 6 months. Priya is a CLAT topper.\"\n\n**Definite Inference:** Priya studied for at least 6 months. ✓\n\n**Why?** It HAS to be true based on the logic.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Probable (Likely True) Inference\n\n> Likely based on the information, but not certain.\n\n**Passage:** \"Most successful lawyers graduated from top law schools.\"\n\n**Probable Inference:** A successful lawyer likely graduated from a top law school.\n\n**Why?** \"Most\" means there are exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Possible (Could Be True) Inference\n\n> Not contradicted, so it could be true.\n\n**Passage:** \"Some students in the class like mathematics.\"\n\n**Possible Inference:** Some students might not like mathematics.\n\n**Why?** \"Some\" allows for this possibility.\n\n---\n\n## The Inference Strength Scale\n\n```\nMUST BE TRUE ────────────────────> COULD BE TRUE\n   (Strong)                            (Weak)\n      ↓                                   ↓\n   Definite     →      Probable     →   Possible\n   Inference          Inference         Inference\n```\n\n**CLAT Preference:** Usually asks for definite inferences.\n\n---\n\n## Common Inference Traps\n\n### Trap 1: The Extreme Inference\n\n**Passage:** \"Many doctors recommend exercise for heart health.\"\n\n**Trap Answer:** \"All doctors recommend exercise.\" ❌\n\n**Why Wrong?** \"Many\" ≠ \"All\" (Too extreme!)\n\n---\n\n### Trap 2: The Reverse Inference\n\n**Passage:** \"All cats are mammals.\"\n\n**Trap Answer:** \"All mammals are cats.\" ❌\n\n**Why Wrong?** Logic doesn't work in reverse.\n\n---\n\n### Trap 3: The Outside Information Trap\n\n**Passage:** \"Company XYZ's profits increased this quarter.\"\n\n**Trap Answer:** \"The stock price will rise.\" ❌\n\n**Why Wrong?** Requires outside knowledge (stock markets).\n\n---\n\n### Trap 4: The Causation Trap\n\n**Passage:** \"Sales increased after the ad campaign launched.\"\n\n**Trap Answer:** \"The ad campaign caused sales to increase.\" ❌\n\n**Why Wrong?** Correlation ≠ Causation.\n\n---\n\n## The Inference Test\n\nFor each potential inference, ask:\n\n| Question | If YES | If NO |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| Is it stated directly? | Check if paraphrased correctly | Could be inferred |\n| Does it HAVE to be true? | Strong inference | Weak inference |\n| Does it require outside info? | ❌ Wrong answer | ✓ Might be correct |\n| Does it go beyond the passage? | ❌ Wrong answer | ✓ Might be correct |\n| Could it be false given the passage? | ❌ Wrong answer | ✓ Might be correct |\n\n---\n\n## Practice: Evaluate These Inferences\n\n**Passage:**\n\"The government announced a new policy requiring all vehicles to pass emission tests. Vehicles failing the test cannot be registered. The policy aims to reduce air pollution in cities.\"\n\n**Potential Inferences:**\n\n1. \"Air pollution is a problem in cities.\"\n   - ✓ Valid (policy aims to reduce it, implying it exists)\n\n2. \"All vehicles currently pass emission tests.\"\n   - ❌ Invalid (nothing suggests this)\n\n3. \"Vehicle emissions contribute to air pollution.\"\n   - ✓ Valid (policy targets vehicles to reduce pollution)\n\n4. \"The policy will definitely reduce air pollution.\"\n   - ❌ Invalid (too extreme - we only know the aim, not the result)\n\n5. \"Some vehicles may fail the emission test.\"\n   - ✓ Valid (otherwise why have the test?)\n\n---\n\n## The CLAT Inference Strategy\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│         THE 4-STEP INFERENCE TEST           │\n│                                             │\n│ 1.

Therefore, it should be approved.\"\n\n**Assumption:** Reducing fever is sufficient for approval.\n\n**Strengthener:** \"Drugs that reduce fever without side effects are approved.\"\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Provide Additional Evidence\n\n**Argument:** \"Caffeine improves focus. Students should drink coffee before exams.\"\n\n**Strengthener:** \"Studies show students who drink coffee perform 15% better on tests.\"\n\n---\n\n### Method 3: Eliminate Alternative Explanations\n\n**Argument:** \"Crime dropped after more police were hired.

          "content": "## Common Logical Fallacies\n\nFallacies are errors in reasoning that make arguments invalid. CLAT tests your ability to spot these!\n\n---\n\n## What is a Fallacy?\n\n> **Definition:**\n> A fallacy is a flaw in reasoning that makes an argument logically invalid, even if the conclusion might be true.\n\n---\n\n## The Most Common Fallacies in CLAT\n\n### 1. Ad Hominem (Attack the Person)\n\n> Attacking the person making the argument instead of the argument itself.\n\n**Example:**\n\"Professor Sharma's research on climate change should be ignored because he once failed a student.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** The professor's past action doesn't affect the validity of the research.\n\n**In CLAT:** Look for arguments that focus on WHO said something rather than WHAT was said.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Straw Man\n\n> Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n\n**Example:**\n\"Advocates for animal rights say we should treat animals exactly like humans. But we can't give voting rights to dogs!\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Animal rights advocates don't actually claim animals should vote.\n\n**In CLAT:** Check if the counter-argument addresses what was actually said.\n\n---\n\n### 3. False Cause (Post Hoc)\n\n> Assuming that because B followed A, A caused B.\n\n**Example:**\n\"Crime increased after the new mayor took office. The mayor caused the crime increase.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Correlation doesn't prove causation.\n\n**In CLAT:** Very common! Always look for alternative explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. False Dichotomy (Either/Or)\n\n> Presenting only two options when more exist.\n\n**Example:**\n\"Either we ban all cars from the city, or air pollution will kill everyone.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Other options exist (electric cars, better public transport, etc.).\n\n**In CLAT:** Look for arguments that ignore middle-ground solutions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hasty Generalization\n\n> Drawing broad conclusions from limited examples.\n\n**Example:**\n\"I met two rude people from City X. People from City X are rude.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Sample too small to generalize.\n\n**In CLAT:** Watch for arguments based on \"some\" or \"few\" examples.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Appeal to Authority (Inappropriate)\n\n> Using an authority figure who isn't an expert in the relevant field.\n\n**Example:**\n\"This famous actor says homeopathy works. Therefore, it's effective medicine.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Actors aren't medical experts.\n\n**In CLAT:** Check if the authority is relevant to the claim.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Circular Reasoning (Begging the Question)\n\n> Using the conclusion as a premise.\n\n**Example:**\n\"The law is just because just laws are made by our legislators, and our legislators make just laws.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Assumes what it's trying to prove.\n\n**In CLAT:** The conclusion shouldn't appear (even rephrased) in the premises.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Slippery Slope\n\n> Claiming one event will lead to extreme consequences without justification.\n\n**Example:**\n\"If we allow students to use calculators, they'll forget all math, fail in life, and society will collapse.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Assumes a chain of events without evidence.\n\n**In CLAT:** Look for dramatic predictions based on small first steps.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Appeal to Emotion\n\n> Using emotional manipulation instead of logical reasoning.\n\n**Example:**\n\"Think of the children! We must ban this book immediately.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Emotion isn't evidence.\n\n**In CLAT:** Identify when arguments rely on fear, pity, or anger.\n\n---\n\n### 10. Red Herring\n\n> Distracting from the main issue with irrelevant information.\n\n**Example:**\nQuestion: \"Should we increase education spending?\"\nAnswer: \"We should focus on the economy because jobs are important.\"\n\n**Why It's Wrong:** Doesn't address the actual question.\n\n**In CLAT:** Check if the response addresses the actual issue.\n\n---\n\n## Fallacy Recognition Table\n\n| Fallacy | Signal Words/Patterns | Example |\n|---------|----------------------|----------|\n| Ad Hominem | Attacks on character | \"He's a liar, so...\" |\n| Straw Man | Extreme misrepresentation | \"So you're saying...\" |\n| False Cause | \"After X, Y happened\" | \"Since the policy, crime rose\" |\n| False Dichotomy | \"Either... or...\" | \"Support us or you're against us\" |\n| Hasty Generalization | \"All X are Y\" from few cases | \"I know two lawyers who...\" |\n| Appeal to Authority | \"Expert says\" (wrong field) | \"Celebrity endorses...\" |\n| Circular Reasoning | Conclusion = Premise | \"True because it's true\" |\n| Slippery Slope | Chain of dramatic predictions | \"This will lead to...\" |\n| Appeal to Emotion | Emotional language | \"Think of...\" \"Imagine...\" |\n| Red Herring | Topic change | Response doesn't match question |\n\n---\n\n## Practice: Spot the Fallacy\n\n**1.** \"My grandfather smoked his whole life and lived to 95. Smoking isn't harmful.\"\n→ **Hasty Generalization** (one case doesn't prove the rule)\n\n**2.** \"You can't trust the climate scientist's data—he drives an SUV!\"\n→ **Ad Hominem** (attacks person, not data)\n\n**3.** \"Either we accept all refugees or we're heartless monsters.\"\n→ **False Dichotomy** (ignores other options)\n\n**4.** \"Everyone knows this policy is correct.\"\n→ **Appeal to Popularity** (popularity doesn't equal truth)\n\n**5.** \"Murder is wrong because killing is immoral.\"\n→ **Circular Reasoning** (conclusion restates premise)\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **Fallacy Detection Strategy:**\n>\n> 1. Identify the conclusion\n> 2. Identify the evidence/reasoning\n> 3. Ask: \"Does the evidence actually support the conclusion?\"\n> 4. If NO, identify WHY the logic fails\n> 5. Match to a fallacy pattern\n>\n> Common CLAT fallacies: False Cause, Hasty Generalization, Ad Hominem",

After six months, employee productivity increased by 20%, while reported stress levels decreased by 40%. The CEO argues that all technology companies should adopt this policy to improve overall industry performance.\"\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Which assumption is NECESSARY for the CEO's argument?**\n\nA) Productivity is more important than work hours.\nB) What works at TechCorp will work at other tech companies.\nC) Employees prefer four-day weeks.\nD) Technology companies have similar productivity needs.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The CEO generalizes from TechCorp to all tech companies.\n- Assumption: TechCorp is representative of the industry.\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n**Q5: Which would STRENGTHEN the CEO's argument?**\n\nA) TechCorp employees received a salary increase along with the new schedule.\nB) Three other tech companies piloted four-day weeks with similar results.\nC) Non-tech companies have tried four-day weeks unsuccessfully.\nD) TechCorp's competitors still use five-day weeks.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- A) Weakens (alternative explanation for productivity)\n- B) Strengthens (more evidence, broader applicability)\n- C) Irrelevant (about non-tech)\n- D) Irrelevant (doesn't affect the argument)\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n**Q6: What is the logical flaw in the CEO's reasoning?**\n\nA) The sample period of six months is too short.\nB) Generalizing from one company to an entire industry.\nC) Ignoring the cost of implementing the policy.\nD) Not considering employee preferences.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The CEO draws a broad conclusion from limited data.\n- This is a hasty generalization.\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n## Passage 3: The Education Debate\n\n**Passage:**\n\"Critics argue that standardized testing narrows the curriculum and stifles creativity. However, countries that emphasize standardized testing, such as Singapore and South Korea, consistently rank among the top in international education assessments. This proves that standardized testing improves educational outcomes.\"\n\n---\n\n**Q7: What is the main flaw in this argument?**\n\nA) It ignores that these countries have different cultures.\nB) It assumes correlation equals causation.\nC) It doesn't define \"educational outcomes.\"\nD) It relies on opinions rather than facts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- High test scores AND standardized testing exist together.\n- But this doesn't prove testing CAUSES good outcomes.\n- Other factors (culture, investment, teaching methods) might be responsible.\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n**Q8: Which would WEAKEN this argument MOST?**\n\nA) Standardized testing is stressful for students.\nB) Finland, which limits standardized testing, also ranks highly.\nC) Singapore spends more on education than India.\nD) South Korea has high rates of student tutoring.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- A) Acknowledges a problem but doesn't address outcomes\n- B) Shows alternative model works (directly contradicts)\n- C) Suggests alternative cause (spending)\n- D) Suggests alternative cause (tutoring)\n\n**Answer: B** (strongest direct counter-example) or C/D (alternative explanations)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Strategy Guide\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              CLAT CR SOLVING FRAMEWORK               │\n│                                                      │\n│  1.

For decades, the Constitution was interpreted as not guaranteeing a fundamental right to privacy. The Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra and the 1962 decision in Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh both declined to recognize privacy as a fundamental right, instead viewing it as a mere common law right that could be curtailed by statute.\n\n**[2]** However, subsequent judgments gradually expanded privacy protections. In Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1975), the Court acknowledged privacy as a right emanating from Articles 19 and 21, though not explicitly declaring it fundamental. This incremental approach reflected the judiciary's caution in expanding constitutional rights without explicit textual support.\n\n**[3]** The watershed moment came with Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017), where a nine-judge bench unanimously declared privacy a fundamental right protected under Article 21. Justice Chandrachud's majority opinion grounded privacy in human dignity, autonomy, and liberty, asserting that \"privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\"\n\n**[4]** Critics of the judgment argue that elevating privacy to fundamental status without constitutional amendment undermines democratic processes. They contend that such significant changes should come through legislative action, not judicial interpretation. Furthermore, they question how privacy rights will be balanced against legitimate state interests in national security and law enforcement.\n\n**[5]** Despite these concerns, the Puttaswamy judgment represents a progressive interpretation of constitutional values. By recognizing privacy as intrinsic to human dignity, the Court aligned Indian jurisprudence with international human rights standards and provided a foundation for data protection legislation and individual autonomy in the digital age.\n\n---\n\n## Paragraph Map\n\n| Para | Function | Key Point |\n|------|----------|----------|\n| ¶1 | Background | Earlier rulings denied privacy as fundamental right |\n| ¶2 | Development | Gradual expansion of privacy protections |\n| ¶3 | Main Event | Puttaswamy judgment declared privacy fundamental |\n| ¶4 | Counterargument | Critics say judicial overreach |\n| ¶5 | Author's View | Supports the judgment as progressive |\n\n---\n\n## Question 1: Main Idea\n\n**The passage is primarily concerned with:**\n\nA) Criticizing the Supreme Court's approach to constitutional interpretation\nB) Tracing the evolution of privacy as a fundamental right in India\nC) Arguing that privacy should not be a fundamental right\nD) Comparing Indian privacy law with international standards\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify question type**\n→ Main Idea question (\"primarily concerned with\")\n\n**Step 2: Apply Umbrella Test**\n- A) Criticizing? No, passage seems supportive (¶5: \"progressive\")\n- B) Tracing evolution? Yes! ¶1-2-3 show historical development\n- C) Against privacy right? No, author supports it (¶5)\n- D) Comparing with international? Only brief mention in ¶5\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n## Question 2: Detail Question\n\n**According to the passage, the Kharak Singh case:**\n\nA) Established privacy as a fundamental right\nB) Recognized privacy as emanating from Article 21\nC) Declined to recognize privacy as a fundamental right\nD) Was decided by a nine-judge bench\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Locate** → Kharak Singh is in ¶1\n\n**Step 2: Find the exact statement**\n→ \"the 1962 decision in Kharak Singh...declined to recognize privacy as a fundamental right\"\n\n**Step 3: Match**\n- A) Established as fundamental? No, it DECLINED ✗\n- B) Article 21? Not mentioned for this case ✗\n- C) Declined to recognize? YES, exact match ✓\n- D) Nine-judge bench? That was Puttaswamy ✗\n\n**Answer: C** ✓\n\n---\n\n## Question 3: Inference Question\n\n**It can be inferred from the passage that before 2017:**\n\nA) Privacy had no legal protection in India\nB) Privacy was protected but not as a constitutional fundamental right\nC) The Constitution explicitly denied privacy rights\nD) All privacy claims were rejected by courts\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Find relevant information**\n→ ¶1: \"mere common law right\" (before Puttaswamy)\n→ ¶2: \"privacy as a right emanating from Articles 19 and 21, though not explicitly declaring it fundamental\"\n\n**Step 2: Test the inference**\n- A) No protection? Wrong—it was a \"common law right\" ✗\n- B) Protected but not fundamental? YES! Matches ¶1-2 ✓\n- C) Constitution explicitly denied? No, it was silent ✗\n- D) All claims rejected? No, Gobind acknowledged some protection ✗\n\n**Answer: B** ✓\n\n---\n\n## Question 4: Vocabulary Question\n\n**As used in paragraph 3, \"watershed\" most nearly means:**\n\nA) A body of water\nB) A dividing ridge\nC) A turning point\nD) A gradual change\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Read in context**\n→ \"The watershed moment came with...Puttaswamy...a nine-judge bench unanimously declared privacy a fundamental right.\"\n\n**Step 2: Substitute and test**\n- \"The body of water moment\" ✗\n- \"The dividing ridge moment\" ✗\n- \"The turning point moment\" ✓ (makes sense!)\n- \"The gradual change moment\" ✗ (was sudden/unanimous)\n\n**Answer: C** ✓\n\n> **Note:** \"Watershed\" literally means a ridge dividing water systems, but figuratively means a turning point—the secondary meaning!\n\n---\n\n## Question 5: Tone Question\n\n**The author's attitude toward the Puttaswamy judgment is best described as:**\n\nA) Harshly critical\nB) Cautiously optimistic\nC) Largely supportive\nD) Completely neutral\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Find opinion markers**\n→ ¶5: \"progressive interpretation,\" \"aligned...with international standards,\" \"provided a foundation\"\n→ ¶4: \"Despite these concerns\" (dismisses criticism)\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate**\n- A) Harshly critical? No, author supports it ✗\n- B) Cautiously optimistic? Some caution, but more than cautious ✗\n- C) Largely supportive? YES! Matches ¶5's positive language ✓\n- D) Completely neutral? No, clear support shown ✗\n\n**Answer: C** ✓\n\n---\n\n## Question 6: Strengthen/Weaken\n\n**Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the critics' argument mentioned in paragraph 4?**\n\nA) Most countries recognize privacy as a constitutional right\nB) The Constitution explicitly allows courts to interpret fundamental rights\nC) Public opinion polls show support for privacy protections\nD) The government has not challenged the Puttaswamy ruling\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify critics' argument**\n→ \"elevating privacy...without constitutional amendment undermines democratic processes\"\n→ \"changes should come through legislative action, not judicial interpretation\"\n\n**Step 2: Find what would counter this**\n- A) Other countries?

Master these 10 rules!\n\n---\n\n## The Basic Principle\n\n> **Singular subjects take singular verbs.**\n> **Plural subjects take plural verbs.**\n\n```\nSingular: The judge IS present.\nPlural:   The judges ARE present.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Rule 1: Ignore Intervening Phrases\n\n> **The subject, not the phrase between subject and verb, determines the verb.**\n\n### Pattern: Subject + [prepositional phrase] + Verb\n\n| Sentence | Subject | Verb |\n|----------|---------|------|\n| The box of chocolates **is** here. | box (singular) | is ✓ |\n| The players on the team **are** ready. | players (plural) | are ✓ |\n| The quality of these mangoes **is** excellent. | quality (singular) | is ✓ |\n\n### Common Intervening Phrases to Ignore:\n- of the...\n- along with...\n- as well as...\n- together with...\n- including...\n- in addition to...\n\n**Example:**\n\"The professor, along with his students, **is** attending the conference.\" ✓\n(Subject = professor, singular)\n\n---\n\n## Rule 2: Compound Subjects with AND\n\n> **Two subjects joined by AND = Plural verb (usually)**\n\n**Normal Case:**\n\"Tom and Jerry **are** friends.\" ✓\n\n### Exceptions:\n\n**When they form a single unit:**\n- \"Bread and butter **is** my breakfast.\" ✓\n- \"The rise and fall of the empire **is** fascinating.\" ✓\n\n**When each/every precedes:**\n- \"Each boy and each girl **has** a book.\" ✓\n- \"Every man and woman **is** welcome.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Rule 3: OR/NOR - Proximity Rule\n\n> **Verb agrees with the NEARER subject.**\n\n| Sentence | Nearer Subject | Verb |\n|----------|---------------|------|\n| Neither the teacher nor the students **were** present. | students (plural) | were ✓ |\n| Neither the students nor the teacher **was** present. | teacher (singular) | was ✓ |\n| Either you or I **am** responsible. | I | am ✓ |\n| Either I or you **are** responsible. | you | are ✓ |\n\n> **CLAT Tip:** Watch for either...or and neither...nor constructions!\n\n---\n\n## Rule 4: Collective Nouns\n\n> **Singular when acting as ONE unit.**\n> **Plural when members act INDIVIDUALLY.**\n\n| Collective Nouns | Example |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| committee, team, jury, family, government, army, crowd, audience, class, staff | |\n\n**As a unit (singular):**\n\"The committee **has** made its decision.\" ✓\n\"The team **is** winning.\" ✓\n\n**As individuals (plural):**\n\"The committee **are** arguing among themselves.\" ✓\n\"The jury **are** divided in their opinions.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Rule 5: Indefinite Pronouns\n\n### Always SINGULAR (memorize these!):\n\n> **\"S-BANE-E\" = Singular pronouns**\n> Someone, Anyone, Everyone, No one\n> Something, Anything, Everything, Nothing\n> Each, Either, Neither\n> Everybody, Anybody, Nobody\n\n\"Everyone **is** present.\" ✓\n\"Neither **was** selected.\" ✓\n\"Each of the students **has** a book.\" ✓\n\n### Always PLURAL:\nboth, few, many, several\n\n\"Both **are** correct.\" ✓\n\"Many **were** absent.\" ✓\n\n### DEPENDS on context:\nall, some, most, any, none\n\n\"All of the water **is** gone.\" (water = uncountable)\n\"All of the cookies **are** gone.\" (cookies = countable)\n\n---\n\n## Rule 6: Inverted Sentences (Here/There)\n\n> **The subject comes AFTER the verb. Find it first!**\n\n\"Here **is** the book.\" (book = singular)\n\"Here **are** the books.\" (books = plural)\n\"There **is** a problem.\" (problem = singular)\n\"There **are** many problems.\" (problems = plural)\n\n---\n\n## Rule 7: Titles and Names\n\n> **Even if they look plural, they take SINGULAR verbs.**\n\n\"The United States **is** a democracy.\" ✓\n\"The News **is** on TV.\" ✓\n\"Economics **is** difficult.\" ✓\n\"Harry Potter **is** a bestseller.\" ✓\n\"Mathematics **was** my favorite subject.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Rule 8: Amounts and Numbers\n\n> **As a single unit = Singular**\n> **As individual items = Plural**\n\n\"Ten kilometers **is** a long distance.\" ✓ (one distance)\n\"Ten rupees **is** enough.\" ✓ (one amount)\n\"Ten students **are** absent.\" ✓ (individual students)\n\n---\n\n## Rule 9: \"Number of\" vs \"A Number of\"\n\n> **THE number of = Singular**\n> **A number of = Plural**\n\n\"**The** number of students **is** increasing.\" ✓\n\"**A** number of students **are** absent.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Rule 10: Relative Pronouns (who, which, that)\n\n> **Verb agrees with the ANTECEDENT (noun before the pronoun).**\n\n\"She is one of those people who **are** always late.\" \n(who refers to people = plural)\n\n\"He is the only one of the students who **has** passed.\"\n(who refers to one = singular)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Practice\n\n**Correct the errors:**\n\n1. \"The news are shocking.\" → **is** (titles = singular)\n2. \"Each of the boys have arrived.\" → **has** (each = singular)\n3. \"Neither he nor I are going.\" → **am** (proximity rule, I = am)\n4. \"A number of students is present.\" → **are** (a number of = plural)\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The 3-Second SVA Check:**\n>\n> 1. Find the REAL subject (ignore phrases)\n> 2. Is it singular or plural?\n> 3. Match the verb\n>\n> Most errors come from intervening phrases. Don't fall for them!",

Conditional Sentences\n\n| Type | If-clause | Main clause |\n|------|-----------|-------------|\n| Real (possible) | Simple Present | will + verb |\n| Unreal (unlikely) | Simple Past | would + verb |\n| Impossible (past) | Past Perfect | would have + past participle |\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"If it **rains**, I **will stay** home.\" (real)\n- \"If I **won** the lottery, I **would travel**.\" (unreal)\n- \"If I **had studied**, I **would have passed**.\" (impossible)\n\n### 2. Reported Speech\n\n> **Direct → Indirect: Tense shifts one step back**\n\n| Direct | Indirect |\n|--------|----------|\n| \"I am tired.\" | He said he **was** tired. |\n| \"I have done it.\" | She said she **had done** it. |\n| \"I will help.\" | He said he **would** help. |\n\n### 3. Time Clauses (when, before, after, until)\n\n> **Use PRESENT tense for future meaning in time clauses!**\n\n**Wrong:** \"I will call you when I **will arrive**.\" ❌\n**Right:** \"I will call you when I **arrive**.\" ✓\n\n**Wrong:** \"Before you **will leave**, check the lights.\" ❌\n**Right:** \"Before you **leave**, check the lights.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Signal Words\n\n| Signal Word | Tense |\n|-------------|-------|\n| yesterday, ago, last week | Simple Past |\n| just, already, yet, ever | Present Perfect |\n| before, by the time, after (past) | Past Perfect |\n| now, at the moment | Present Continuous |\n| always, usually, often | Simple Present |\n| tomorrow, next week | Simple Future |\n| since, for (with duration) | Present Perfect |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Practice\n\n**Choose the correct tense:**\n\n1. \"By the time we reached, the movie ___ (start).\"\n   → **had started** (past perfect - earlier action)\n\n2. \"I ___ (live) in Delhi since 2010.\"\n   → **have lived** (present perfect - duration to now)\n\n3. \"If he ___ (be) honest, I would trust him.\"\n   → **were** (unreal conditional - past tense)\n\n4. \"She said she ___ (will) come.\"\n   → **would** (reported speech shift)\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The Tense Triangle:**\n>\n> 1. What TIME is the action? (past/present/future)\n> 2. Is it COMPLETE or ONGOING?\n> 3. Does it CONNECT to another time?\n>\n> Answer these three questions, and the tense becomes clear!",

Misplaced Modifiers\n\n> **Rule:** A modifier should be placed NEXT TO what it modifies.\n\n**Wrong:** \"She served cake to the children on paper plates.\" ❌\n(Were the children on paper plates?)\n\n**Right:** \"She served cake on paper plates to the children.\" ✓\n\n**Wrong:** \"He almost drove for five hours.\" ❌\n(He almost drove? Or he drove for almost five hours?)\n\n**Right:** \"He drove for almost five hours.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dangling Modifiers\n\n> **Rule:** The modifier must have a CLEAR subject to modify.\n\n**Wrong:** \"Walking in the park, the birds were singing.\" ❌\n(Were the birds walking?)\n\n**Right:** \"Walking in the park, I heard birds singing.\" ✓\n(I was walking.)\n\n**Wrong:** \"After reading the book, the movie seemed disappointing.\" ❌\n(The movie didn't read the book!)\n\n**Right:** \"After reading the book, I found the movie disappointing.\" ✓\n\n### The Dangling Modifier Test:\n\n> Ask: \"Who is doing the action in the modifier?\"\n> That person MUST be the subject of the main clause.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Squinting Modifiers\n\n> **Rule:** Avoid ambiguity when a modifier could modify either side.\n\n**Wrong:** \"Students who study rarely fail exams.\" ❌\n(Do they rarely study? Or do they rarely fail?)\n\n**Right:** \"Students who rarely study fail exams.\" ✓\nOR \"Students who study fail exams rarely.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Common Misplaced Modifier Words\n\n| Word | Position | Example |\n|------|----------|----------|\n| only | Before what it limits | \"I **only** ate the cake\" (nothing else) vs \"I ate **only** the cake\" (no other food) |\n| almost, nearly | Before numbers/amounts | \"He drove for **almost** five hours\" |\n| just | Before what it limits | \"I **just** want to help\" |\n| even | Before what it emphasizes | \"**Even** she passed\" (surprisingly) |\n\n---\n\n## Parallelism: Matching Structures\n\nParallelism means items in a series must have the SAME grammatical structure.\n\n---\n\n### Rule: Match the Form\n\n**Wrong:** \"She likes **swimming**, **to run**, and **biking**.\" ❌\n(gerund, infinitive, gerund - inconsistent!)\n\n**Right:** \"She likes **swimming**, **running**, and **biking**.\" ✓\n(all gerunds)\n\n**Right:** \"She likes **to swim**, **to run**, and **to bike**.\" ✓\n(all infinitives)\n\n---\n\n### Parallelism in Lists\n\n**Wrong:** \"The recipe calls for **tomatoes**, **onions**, and **to add garlic**.\" ❌\n\n**Right:** \"The recipe calls for **tomatoes**, **onions**, and **garlic**.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Parallelism in Comparisons\n\n**Wrong:** \"I prefer **reading** to **watch TV**.\" ❌\n\n**Right:** \"I prefer **reading** to **watching TV**.\" ✓\n\n**Wrong:** \"**To err** is human; **forgiving** is divine.\" ❌\n\n**Right:** \"**To err** is human; **to forgive** is divine.\" ✓\nOR \"**Erring** is human; **forgiving** is divine.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Parallelism with Correlative Conjunctions\n\n> **Both...and, Either...or, Neither...nor, Not only...but also**\n>\n> What follows the first word must MATCH what follows the second.\n\n**Wrong:** \"She is **both** intelligent **and** has ambition.\" ❌\n(adjective and verb phrase)\n\n**Right:** \"She is **both** intelligent **and** ambitious.\" ✓\n(adjective and adjective)\n\n**Wrong:** \"He **not only** sings **but also** is a dancer.\" ❌\n\n**Right:** \"He is **not only** a singer **but also** a dancer.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Parallelism Checklist\n\n| Check For | Example |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Same verb form | running, swimming, cycling |\n| Same part of speech | quick, efficient, reliable (all adjectives) |\n| Same sentence structure | who works hard, who studies well |\n| Matching after correlatives | both X and Y (X and Y match) |\n\n---\n\n## Practice: Fix These Sentences\n\n**1.** \"Driving on the highway, the mountains came into view.\"\n→ \"Driving on the highway, we saw the mountains.\" ✓\n\n**2.** \"She enjoys reading, to paint, and baking.\"\n→ \"She enjoys reading, painting, and baking.\" ✓\n\n**3.** \"The report was not only late but also was incomplete.\"\n→ \"The report was not only late but also incomplete.\" ✓\n\n**4.** \"Walking quickly, the bus was missed.\"\n→ \"Walking quickly, he missed the bus.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The Parallelism Pattern:**\n>\n> Look for:\n> - Lists (A, B, and C)\n> - Comparisons (X rather than Y)\n> - Correlatives (both...and, not only...but also)\n>\n> Check: Are all items in the SAME form?",

          "content": "## The CLAT Sentence Correction Approach\n\nSentence correction tests multiple grammar concepts in one question. Here's how to tackle them systematically.\n\n---\n\n## The ERROR SCAN Method\n\n> **E** = Examine the underlined portion\n> **R** = Review for common errors\n> **R** = Recognize the error type\n> **O** = Options comparison\n> **R** = Re-read with correction\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Identify Error Types\n\nScan for these common errors (in order of frequency):\n\n| Error Type | What to Check |\n|------------|---------------|\n| **Subject-Verb Agreement** | Does verb match subject? |\n| **Tense Errors** | Is tense consistent and correct? |\n| **Pronoun Errors** | Clear reference? Correct case? |\n| **Parallelism** | Same form in lists/comparisons? |\n| **Modifier Errors** | Placed next to what it modifies? |\n| **Word Choice** | Right word used? |\n| **Comparisons** | Comparing like with like? |\n| **Idiom Errors** | Correct preposition? |\n\n---\n\n## Common Error Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Subject-Verb in Long Sentences\n\n**Sentence:** \"The collection of ancient artifacts discovered in the excavation **were** donated to the museum.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Subject: collection (singular)\n- Verb: were (plural) ❌\n- Correction: \"...artifacts discovered in the excavation **was** donated...\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 2: Tense Shift\n\n**Sentence:** \"The lawyer presented the evidence and **argues** that the defendant was innocent.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- presented = past\n- argues = present ❌\n- Correction: \"...and **argued** that...\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 3: Faulty Comparison\n\n**Sentence:** \"The population of India is greater than **China**.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Comparing population (thing) with China (country) ❌\n- Correction: \"...greater than **that of China** / **China's**.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 4: Pronoun Reference\n\n**Sentence:** \"When the manager met with the employee, **he** was nervous.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Who was nervous? Ambiguous! ❌\n- Correction: \"When the manager met with the employee, **the manager** was nervous.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 5: Parallelism in Lists\n\n**Sentence:** \"The job requires **experience**, **being dedicated**, and **a good communicator**.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- experience (noun)\n- being dedicated (gerund phrase) ❌\n- a good communicator (noun phrase) ❌\n- Correction: \"...requires **experience**, **dedication**, and **communication skills**.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 6: Dangling Modifier\n\n**Sentence:** \"**Running late for the meeting**, the door was left unlocked.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Who was running late? Not the door! ❌\n- Correction: \"**Running late for the meeting**, **she** left the door unlocked.\" ✓\n\n---\n\n### Pattern 7: Idiom Errors\n\n**Common Idiom Corrections:**\n\n| Wrong | Right |\n|-------|-------|\n| different than | different from |\n| prefer X over Y | prefer X to Y |\n| regard X like Y | regard X as Y |\n| compare X to Y (differences) | compare X with Y |\n| prohibit from | prohibit (no preposition) OR prohibit from doing |\n| capable to | capable of |\n| interested to | interested in |\n\n---\n\n## The Elimination Strategy\n\nWhen you can't find the error directly:\n\n### Step 1: Compare Answer Choices\n\nLook for differences between options. These differences reveal what's being tested.\n\n### Step 2: Eliminate Clearly Wrong Options\n\n- Eliminate options with obvious grammar errors\n- Eliminate options that change the meaning\n- Eliminate wordy or awkward options\n\n### Step 3: Choose the Cleaner Option\n\nWhen two options seem correct, choose:\n- The shorter one (if meaning is preserved)\n- The active voice over passive\n- The simpler construction\n\n---\n\n## Practice Sentences\n\n**1.** \"Neither the professor nor his students **was/were** prepared for the exam.\"\n→ **were** (students is nearer, plural)\n\n**2.** \"The data **suggest/suggests** that the theory is correct.\"\n→ **suggest** (data = plural in formal usage)\n\n**3.** \"She is one of those teachers who **inspire/inspires** students.\"\n→ **inspire** (who refers to teachers, plural)\n\n**4.** \"Being an expert in the field, **the book was written by the professor / the professor wrote the book**.\"\n→ **the professor wrote the book** (modifier must attach to person)\n\n**5.** \"The company not only reduced costs **but also increased / but also it increased** profits.\"\n→ **but also increased** (parallelism: reduced...increased)\n\n---\n\n## Error Frequency in CLAT\n\n| Error Type | Frequency |\n|------------|----------|\n| Subject-Verb Agreement | Very High |\n| Tense Errors | High |\n| Pronoun Issues | High |\n| Parallelism | Medium |\n| Modifier Errors | Medium |\n| Idiom/Word Choice | Medium |\n| Comparison Errors | Low |\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> **The 30-Second Check:**\n>\n> 1. Read the sentence quickly\n> 2. Does something \"sound\" wrong? Trust your instinct!\n> 3. Identify the error type\n> 4. Find the option that fixes ONLY that error\n>\n> Don't overthink. The error is usually straightforward!",

Think 1/3\n- See 16.67%? Think 1/6\n- See 12.5%? Think 1/8\n\n---\n\n### Shortcut 11: The \"Of\" Rule\n\n**X% of Y = Y% of X**\n\n**Example**: 8% of 25 = 25% of 8 = 2\n\n(The second one is easier to calculate!)\n\n---\n\n### Shortcut 12: Percentage Point vs Percentage Change\n\n**Percentage Points**: Simple subtraction\n- Interest went from 10% to 12% → Increased by 2 percentage points\n\n**Percentage Change**: Relative change\n- Interest went from 10% to 12% → Increased by 20% (2/10 × 100)\n\n---\n\n## Common CLAT Percentage Traps\n\n| Trap | Reality |\n|------|--------|\n| Thinking 50% increase = 50% decrease | 50% increase needs 33.33% decrease to restore |\n| Adding successive percentages | Must use: a + b + ab/100 |\n| Confusing percentage points with percentage change | They're different! |\n| Forgetting the base changes | Always check what the percentage is \"of\" |",

Find ratio.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Cheaper (C) = 40, Dearer (D) = 60, Mean (M) = 45\n- Ratio = (60-45) : (45-40) = 15 : 5 = **3 : 1**\n\n### Alligation Example 2: Solution Mixing\n\n**Problem**: Mix 20% alcohol solution with 50% alcohol solution to get 30% solution. Find ratio.\n\n**Solution**:\n- C = 20%, D = 50%, M = 30%\n- Ratio = (50-30) : (30-20) = 20 : 10 = **2 : 1**\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Partnership Problems\n\n### Basic Partnership\n**Same time investment**: Profit ratio = Investment ratio\n\n**Example**: A invests 5000, B invests 7000\n- Profit ratio = 5000 : 7000 = 5 : 7\n\n### Compound Partnership\n**Different time investment**: Profit ratio = (Investment × Time) ratio\n\n**Example**: A invests 5000 for 6 months, B invests 7000 for 4 months\n- A's contribution = 5000 × 6 = 30000\n- B's contribution = 7000 × 4 = 28000\n- Profit ratio = 30000 : 28000 = **15 : 14**\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Age Problems Using Ratios\n\n### The Key Insight\n**The difference in ages remains constant over time!**\n\n**Example**: Present ages of A and B are in ratio 3:5. After 4 years, ratio becomes 2:3. Find ages.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Let ages be 3x and 5x\n- After 4 years: (3x+4)/(5x+4) = 2/3\n- Cross multiply: 3(3x+4) = 2(5x+4)\n- 9x + 12 = 10x + 8\n- x = 4\n- Ages: **12 and 20 years**\n\n---\n\n## Quick Ratio Tricks\n\n### Trick 1: Finding Original from Ratio and Difference\n\nIf ratio is a:b and difference is D:\n- Larger = D × b/(b-a)\n- Smaller = D × a/(b-a)\n\n**Example**: Ratio 3:5, difference 20\n- Smaller = 20 × 3/2 = 30\n- Larger = 20 × 5/2 = 50\n\n### Trick 2: Combining Ratios\n\nIf A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5\n- Make B same: A:B = 8:12 and B:C = 12:15\n- A:B:C = **8:12:15**\n\n### Trick 3: Ratio to Percentage\n\n- 1:4 means 1 out of 5 = 20%\n- 2:3 means 2 out of 5 = 40%",

Find net of first two\n2. Apply third discount to result\n\n---\n\n## The Markup-Discount Relationship\n\n### Key Insight\n**To have no profit/loss after giving discount:**\nMarkup % = (Discount% / (100 - Discount%)) × 100\n\n| Discount | Required Markup (for no P/L) |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| 10% | 11.11% |\n| 20% | 25% |\n| 25% | 33.33% |\n| 30% | 42.86% |\n| 40% | 66.67% |\n\n---\n\n## The False Weight Trick\n\n### The Problem\nDishonest seller uses less weight but charges for full weight.\n\n### The Formula\n**Profit% = (True Weight - False Weight) / False Weight × 100**\n\n**Or**: Profit% = (Extra Weight / False Weight) × 100\n\n### Examples\n\n| Sells | As | Profit % |\n|-------|-----|----------|\n| 900g | 1kg | 11.11% |\n| 800g | 1kg | 25% |\n| 950g | 1kg | 5.26% |\n\n---\n\n## The Two-Article Traps\n\n### TRAP 1: Same CP, Different P/L%\n\n**Scenario**: Two articles at same CP. One sold at X% profit, other at X% loss.\n\n**Result**: **No profit, No loss!**\n\n**Why**: Profit on one = Loss on other (since same CP)\n\n---\n\n### TRAP 2: Same SP, Different P/L% (THE FAMOUS TRAP!)\n\n**Scenario**: Two articles sold at same SP. One at X% profit, other at X% loss.\n\n**Result**: **ALWAYS A LOSS!**\n\n**Formula**: Loss% = (Common %)² / 100 = X²/100\n\n**Example**: Two items sold at same price, one at 20% profit, one at 20% loss\n- Loss% = 20²/100 = 400/100 = **4% loss**\n\n**Why this happens**: The CP with profit is lower, CP with loss is higher. Total CP > Total SP.\n\n---\n\n## Profit on Cost vs Profit on Sale\n\n### Conversion Formulas\n\n**Profit on Cost (P%) to Profit on Sale (S%)**:\nS = (P / (100 + P)) × 100\n\n**Profit on Sale (S%) to Profit on Cost (P%)**:\nP = (S / (100 - S)) × 100\n\n| On Cost | On Sale |\n|---------|--------|\n| 10% | 9.09% |\n| 20% | 16.67% |\n| 25% | 20% |\n| 33.33% | 25% |\n| 50% | 33.33% |\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problems with Solutions\n\n### Problem 1\n**A shopkeeper marks goods 40% above CP and gives 20% discount. Find profit%.**\n\nSolution:\n- Let CP = 100\n- MP = 140 (40% above)\n- SP = 140 × 0.8 = 112 (20% discount)\n- Profit = 112 - 100 = 12\n- **Profit% = 12%**\n\n**Shortcut**: (100+40)(100-20)/100 - 100 = 140×80/100 - 100 = 112 - 100 = 12%\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2\n**After 20% and 10% successive discounts, SP is Rs.360. Find MP.**\n\nSolution:\n- Net discount = 20 + 10 - 2 = 28%\n- SP = MP × 72/100\n- 360 = MP × 0.72\n- **MP = Rs.500**\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3\n**A sells to B at 20% profit. B sells to C at 25% profit. If C pays Rs.1500, what did A pay?**\n\nSolution:\n- B's SP = C's CP = 1500\n- B's CP = 1500/1.25 = 1200\n- A's SP = B's CP = 1200\n- A's CP = 1200/1.2 = **Rs.1000**",

Pie Charts\n**Frequency**: 15% of DI sets\n**Key Formulas**:\n- Angle = (Value/Total) × 360°\n- Value = (Angle/360°) × Total\n\n### 4. Line Graphs\n**Frequency**: 15% of DI sets\n**Best for**: Trends over time\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reading Tips\n\n### For Tables\n1. Read row and column headers first\n2. Identify the unit row (usually top or in title)\n3. Note any totals/averages given\n\n### For Bar Charts\n1. Check Y-axis scale and starting point\n2. Note if bars are grouped or stacked\n3. Look for legend if multiple series\n\n### For Pie Charts\n1. Check if values are in % or absolute numbers\n2. Note the total value (often in center or title)\n3. Remember: all slices = 100% = 360°\n\n### For Line Graphs\n1. Check both axes' scales\n2. Identify trend direction (up/down/flat)\n3. Note intersection points\n\n---\n\n## Common CLAT DI Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Year-wise Data\n- Company sales over 5 years\n- Export/Import figures annually\n- Production statistics\n\n**Typical questions**: Growth rate, best/worst year, average\n\n### Pattern 2: Category Comparison\n- Performance of different products\n- State-wise statistics\n- Department-wise expenditure\n\n**Typical questions**: Highest/lowest, ratio between categories\n\n### Pattern 3: Component Analysis\n- Budget allocation\n- Market share\n- Resource distribution\n\n**Typical questions**: What fraction, percentage of whole, combining components\n\n---\n\n## Time Management Strategy\n\n| Task | Time |\n|------|------|\n| Read data structure | 10-15 sec |\n| Read question | 5 sec |\n| Locate data | 5-10 sec |\n| Calculate | 30-40 sec |\n| Mark answer | 5 sec |\n| **Total per question** | **60-75 sec** |",

Tort law deals with civil wrongs that cause harm or loss to others.\n\n---\n\n## Tort vs. Crime vs. Contract\n\n| Aspect | Tort | Crime | Contract |\n|--------|------|-------|----------|\n| **Nature** | Civil wrong | Wrong against state | Breach of agreement |\n| **Parties** | Individual vs. Individual | State vs. Accused | Parties to contract |\n| **Remedy** | Damages/Compensation | Punishment | Specific performance/Damages |\n| **Standard of Proof** | Balance of probabilities | Beyond reasonable doubt | Balance of probabilities |\n\n---\n\n## Essential Elements of a Tort\n\n```\nTORT = WRONGFUL ACT + LEGAL DAMAGE + LEGAL REMEDY\n```\n\n### 1. Wrongful Act or Omission\n- An act that violates a legal right of another\n- Can be a positive act OR failure to act\n\n### 2. Legal Damage (Injuria)\n- Actual violation of a legal right\n- Not mere harm or inconvenience\n\n### 3. Legal Remedy\n- The law must provide a remedy\n- \"Ubi jus ibi remedium\" (Where there is a right, there is a remedy)\n\n---\n\n## Key Maxims in Tort Law\n\n### 1. Damnum Sine Injuria\n> **\"Damage without legal injury\"**\n\n**Meaning:** Suffering actual damage but no violation of legal right = No tort\n\n**Case: Gloucester Grammar School Case (1410)**\nA schoolmaster opened a new school near an existing school, causing the old school to lose students.\n\n**Held:** No tort. Competition is not a legal wrong.\n\n### 2. Injuria Sine Damno\n> **\"Legal injury without actual damage\"**\n\n**Meaning:** Violation of legal right even without actual loss = Actionable tort\n\n**Case: Ashby v. White (1703)**\nA returning officer wrongfully refused to register Ashby's vote. The candidate Ashby voted for won anyway.\n\n**Held:** Ashby could still sue. His legal right to vote was violated.\n\n---\n\n## General Defenses in Torts\n\n### 1. Volenti Non Fit Injuria\n> **\"No injury is done to a willing person\"**\n\nIf you voluntarily consent to risk, you cannot sue for resulting harm.\n\n### 2. Act of God (Vis Major)\n- Natural event without human intervention\n- Extraordinary, not foreseeable\n\n### 3. Inevitable Accident\n- Accident that couldn't be prevented\n- Despite reasonable care\n\n### 4. Private Defense\n- Use of reasonable force\n- To protect person or property\n\n### 5. Statutory Authority\n- Acting under authority of law\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> Remember the key distinction:\n> - **Damnum sine injuria** = Damage but no legal wrong = NO action\n> - **Injuria sine damno** = Legal wrong but no damage = Action lies",

Duty of Care\n- Defendant must owe a duty to plaintiff\n\n**The Neighbor Principle - Donoghue v. Stevenson (1932)**\n\n**Facts:** Mrs. Donoghue drank ginger beer from an opaque bottle. A decomposed snail was inside. She fell ill.\n\n**Lord Atkin's Rule:**\n> \"You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor.\"\n\n### 2. Breach of Duty\n- Defendant failed to meet the required standard of care\n- Standard = What a \"reasonable person\" would do\n\n### 3. Causation\n- Breach must CAUSE the damage\n- \"But For\" Test: But for the defendant's breach, would the damage have occurred?\n\n### 4. Damage\n- Actual, provable damage must occur\n\n---\n\n## Res Ipsa Loquitur\n> **\"The thing speaks for itself\"**\n\nWhen the accident itself suggests negligence.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Defendant had exclusive control\n2. Accident wouldn't normally occur without negligence\n3. Plaintiff didn't contribute\n\n**Example:** Surgical instrument left inside patient's body\n\n---\n\n## Contributory Negligence\n\n**Definition:** Plaintiff's own negligence contributed to the harm.\n\n**Effect in India:** Damages reduced proportionally (not complete defense).\n\n---\n\n## CLAT Tip\n\n> For negligence questions, work through ALL FOUR elements systematically.\n> If ANY element is missing, negligence is NOT established.",

Premises\n- Facts or evidence given in the argument\n- Stated explicitly\n\n### 2. Conclusion\n- What the argument is trying to prove\n- Often signaled by: Therefore, Hence, Thus, Consequently\n\n### 3. Assumptions\n- Unstated beliefs that MUST be true for the conclusion to follow\n- NOT stated in the argument\n\n---\n\n## Finding the Assumption\n\n**The Negation Test:**\n1. Negate (flip) the potential assumption\n2. If the argument falls apart → It's a necessary assumption\n3. If argument still works → Not an assumption\n\n**Example:**\n> Premise: Ram scored highest in all tests this semester.\n> Conclusion: Ram will top the final exam.\n\n**What's assumed?** Past performance predicts future performance\n\n---\n\n## Types of Assumptions\n\n### 1.
